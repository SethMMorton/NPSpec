  abstract = {Ruthenium compounds, particularly Ru(II) polypyridine complexes, are the class of transition metal complexes which has been most deeply investigated from a photochemical viewpoint. The reason for such great interest stems from a unique combination of chemical stability, redox properties, excited-state reactivity, luminescence emission, and excited-state lifetime. Ruthenium polypyridine complexes are indeed good visible light absorbers, feature relatively intense and long-lived luminescence, and can undergo reversible redox processes in both the ground and excited states. This chapter presents some general concepts on the photochemical properties of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes and gives an overview of various research topics involving ruthenium photochemistry which have emerged in the last 15 years. In particular, aspects connected to supramolecular photochemistry and photophysics are discussed, such as multicomponent systems for light harvesting and photoinduced charge separation, systems for photoinduced multielectron/hole storage, and photocatalytic processes based on supramolecular Ru(II) polypyridine species. Interaction with biological systems and dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density-functional response theory (TD-DFRT) is presented from the point of view of quantum chemistry. The extension of density-functional theory (DFT) into the time-domain is reviewed from the point of view of Runge, Gross, and Kohn. The basic working equations of TD-DFRT are then derived in a form analogous to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) equations used for molecular calculations. This is the first practical formulation of TD-DFRT for molecular applications, and the equations are presented in a more general form than has been the case for either atoms or solids. In particular, the present TD-DFRT equations anticipate applications to open-shell molecules based on spin-unrestricted DFT equations with fractional occupation numbers, and are general enough to accept time-dependent exchange-correlation functionals beyond the adiabatic approximation. The use of auxiliary function techniques to eliminate the four-center integrals that arise in TD-DFRT is discussed. The simple example of H2 is used to illustrate the TD-DFRT method and its relationship to TDHF and to the usual ad hoc $\Delta$SCF-based DFT treatment of excited states. The TD-DFRT method set forth here provides a powerful DFT technique for the calculation of such optical properties as dynamic polarizabilities and electronic excitation spectra, and can be readily extended to treat a number of other properties such as hyperpolarizabilities and intermolecular forces.},

The formal foundations, molecular formulation, and molecular algorithm are summarized. The remainder of the article is devoted to an examination of the features of exchange-correlation functionals that are most important for the calculation of molecular electronic spectra and response properties. Thus attention is given to the long-range behavior of the exchange-correlation potential and to the TD-DFRT ionization threshold. First the strengths and limitations of the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) are examined, followed by a review of some of the methods which have been used to go beyond the TDLDA. The Sham-Schl\"uter and optimized effective potential methods for the calculation of the exact exchange-correlation potential, vxc are reviewed, and some new results are presented for the derivative $\delta$vxc(r)/$\delta$$\pi$(r′)=$\delta$2Exc/$\delta$$\pi$ (r)$\delta$$\pi$(\'r) which plays key r\^ole in TD-DFRT within the adiabatic approximation. Finally heuristic connections are made between Hartree-Fock, exchange-only TD-DFRT, and exchange-only SCF-based density-functional theory for the calculation of excitation energies.},

  abstract = {DDSCAT 7.2 is a freely available open-source Fortran-90 software package applying the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) to calculate scattering and absorption of electromagnetic waves by targets with arbitrary geometries and complex refractive index. The targets may be isolated entities (e.g., dust particles), but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of "target unit cells", which can be used to study absorption, scattering, and electric fields around arrays of nanostructures. The DDA approximates the target by an array of polarizable points. The theory of the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988) and Draine & Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures in Draine & Flatau (2008). Efficient near-field calculations are enabled following Flatau & Draine (2012). DDSCAT 7.2 allows accurate calculations of electromagnetic scattering from targets with size parameters 2*pi*aeff/lambda < 25 provided the refractive index m is not large compared to unity (|m-1| < 2). DDSCAT 7.2 includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). DDSCAT 7.2 supports calculations for a variety of target geometries (e.g., ellipsoids, regular tetrahedra, rectangular solids, finite cylinders, hexagonal prisms, etc.). Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to import new target geometries into the code. DDSCAT 7.2 calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and selected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for specified orientation of the target relative to the incident wave, and for specified scattering directions. DDSCAT 7.2 calculates E throughout a user-specified rectangular volume containing the target. A Fortran-90 code READNF to read E and P from files created by DDSCAT 7.2 is included in the distribution.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence experiments are typically performed in sample geometries that are large relative to the size of the fluorophores and relative to the absorption and emission wavelengths. In this arrangement the fluorophores radiate into free space. Most of our knowledge and intuition about fluorescence is derived from the spectral properties observed in these free-space conditions. However, the presence of nearby metallic surfaces or particles can alter the free-space condition, which can result in dramatic spectral changes which are distinct from those observable in the absence of metal surfaces. Remarkably, metal surfaces can increase or decrease the radiative decay rates of fluorophores and increase the extent of resonance energy transfer (RET) (Figure 1).These effects are due to interactions of the excited-state fluorophores with free electrons in the metal, the so-called surface plasmon electrons, which polarize the metal and produce favorable effects on the fluorophore. The effects of metallic surfaces are complex and include quenching at short distances, spatial variation of the incident light field, and changes in the radiative decay rates (Figure 2). We refer to the use of fluorophore-metal interactions as radiative decay engineering (RDE) or metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF).},

It has been well established that the brightness of fluorophores significantly increases at close proximity to silvered surfaces (deposited colloids or islands) [1-6]. This effect is accompanied by dramatically decreased lifetimes, indicating a significant increase in radiative decay rates [3, 6-8]. Shorter lifetimes enable higher photostability of fluorophores [8-10]. The strongest enhancements were observed for fractal silver structures [11] and for overlabeled macromolecules where the self-quenching was released [12-13]. The effects of noble metal particles on fluorescence are described in several chapters in this volume.},

  abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy of biomolecules like enzymes, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and their components, is in most cases the vibrational spectroscopy of large molecules in aqueous solution or in vivo. Since large molecules in solution are likely to yield conventional infrared (IR) and Raman spectra with many close-lying peaks, spectroscopic techniques which filter out information selectively are of special interest in this field. Because of the large size of the investigated molecules and the lack of reliable rules of thumb for many special techniques, accurate first-principles calculations are an important means of interpreting the resulting spectra. First-principle calculations on biomolecules in solution have to cope with the challenges arising from the size of the systems under study, which make selective computational techniques an essential tool in order to be able to investigate biomolecular systems of reasonable size with sufficient computational accuracy. This is why the focus of this work is on the selective first-principles calculation of vibrational spectra of biomolecules obtained by special techniques such as difference IR and Raman, Vibrational Circular Dichroism, Raman Optical Activity, resonance Raman, and also Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy, two-dimensional IR and Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy. For each of these techniques, a short introduction of their relevance for studies on biomolecules is given. Theoretical as well as practical aspects of calculating the corresponding intensities are discussed and complemented by references to original work on these topics.},

  abstract = {The screened Coulomb hybrid density functional theory developed in this work extends the applicability of hybrid functionals to large molecules and solids. Traditional hybrid functionals have been applied to medium sized molecules and some insulating solids with excellent results. However, the fundamentally long range of the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange interaction limits their use for biomolecules and semi-conducting or metallic solids. The large spatial extent of the HF exchange can be reduced by utilizing a screened Coulomb potential. Such potentials have been widely used in solid state physics. Efforts of employing them in quantum chemistry were not as successful due to theunsatisfactory accuracy of the resulting methods. This work takes a new approach by combining a screened HF potential with both short and long range screened density functionals. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) screened Coulomb hybrid density functional is designed to produce exchange energies comparable to traditional hybrids while only using the short range, screened HF exchange. The accuracy of the HSE functional is assessed on a wide range of molecules and solids. Enthalpies of formation, geometries and vibrational frequencies of the G3 set of 223 molecules are predicted with performance equivalent to the best traditional hybrids. A set of 21 insulating, semi-conducting and metallic solids was used to determine the accuracy of lattice constants and bulk moduli. Both properties show significantly improved accuracy, compared to pure density functionals. HSE also accurately predicts band gaps of semi-conductors whereas pure density functionals severely underestimate the band gaps. Benchmarking of HSE in several semi-conducting and metallic solids shows a drastic decrease in computational cost, compared to established hybrid functionals. HSE achieves linear scaling for medium size systems (greater than 15 ˚A) whereas regular hybrids scale as O(N2.5) for systems up to 100 ˚A and scale linearly only beyond that. This late cross-over makes it computationally prohibitive to treat complex solids with traditional hybrid functionals. HSE circumvents this bottleneck and produces superior results while increasing computational cost by a factor of only two to four, compared to pure density functional theory.},

@INCOLLECTION{Leeuwen_2006_incollection,
  abstract = {The Runge-Gross theorem [Runge 1984] states that for a given initial state the time-dependent density is a unique functional of the external potential. Let us elaborate a bit further on this point. Suppose we could solve the timedependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation (TDSE) for a given many-body system, i.e., we specify an initial state |\psi0> at t = t0 and evolve the wave function in time using the Hamiltonian H(t). Then, from the wave function, we can calculate the time-dependent density n(r, t). We can then ask the question whether exactly the same density n(r, t) can be reproduced by an external potential \nu'ext(r, t) in a system with a different given initial state and a different two-particle interaction, and if so, whether this potential is unique (modulo a purely time-dependent function). The answer to this question is obviously of great importance for the construction of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. The Kohn-Sham system has no two-particle interaction and differs in this respect from the fully interacting system. It has, in general, also a different initial state. This state is usually a Slater determinant rather than a fully interacting initial state. A time-dependent Kohn-Sham system therefore only exists if the question posed above is answered affirmatively. Note that this is a \nu-representability question: Is a density belonging to an interacting system also noninteracting \nu-representable? We will show in this chapter that, with some restrictions on the initial states and potentials, this question can indeed be answered affirmatively [van Leeuwen 1999, van Leeuwen 2001, Giuliani 2005]. We stress that we demonstrate here that the interacting-\nu-representable densities are also noninteracting \nu-representable rather than aiming at characterizing the set of \nu-representable densities. The latter question has inspired much work in ground state density functional theory (for extensive discussion see [van Leeuwen 2003]) and has only been answered satisfactorily for quantum lattice systems [Chayes 1985].},

TDDFT can be viewed as an alternative formulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics but, in contrast to the normal approach that relies on wave-functions and on the many-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, its basic variable is the one-body electron density, n(r, t). The advantages are clear: The many-body wave-function, a function in a 3N-dimensional space (where N is the number of electrons in the system), is a very complex mathematical object, while the density is a simple function that depends solely on the 3-dimensional vector r. The standard way to obtain n(r, t) is with the help of a fictitious system of noninteracting electrons, the Kohn-Sham system. The final equations are simple to tackle numerically, and are routinely solved for systems with a large number of atoms. These electrons feel an effective potential, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential. The exact form of this potential is unknown, and has therefore to be approximated.},

  abstract = {Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was discovered in 1978 and has grown to become a significant surface diagnostic and analytical technique. It has also launched a wide variety of investigations into the electromagnetic, and especially the optical, properties of nanostructured disordered materials. A number of phenomena contribute to SERS including adsorbate resonances as well as new resonances (such as metal to molecule charge transfer transitions) that result form the formation of the adsorbate-to-surface bonds, or other adsorbate-metal interactions. Chief among the contributions to SERS, however, is the enhancement of the optical fields in the vicinity of the nanoparticles constituting the SERS-active system. The field enhancement is especially high when highly localizable resonances such as surface plasmons are excited. Aggregates and assemblies of nanoparticles (of appropriate materials) can, in turn, manifest unusually enhanced SERS by virtue of particle-particle interactions. For example, while the SERS enhancement in the vicinity of single silver nanoparticles rarely exceed 104, the Raman spectrum of molecules located in the interstitial volume between two closely-spaced nanoparticles can be enhanced some 10 orders of magnitude when the two particles approach each another to within molecular dimensions and the system is excited at an appropriate wavelength. Other aggregates can Show similar levels of enhancement at special locations within the aggregate. Large fractal aggregates form a special class of enhancing aggregates. Illuminating such aggregates, in general, results in a highly inhomogeneous distribution of enhancement over the body of the aggregate with electromagnetic hot Spots where the Raman enhancement can reach or slightly exceed 10 orders of magnitude. Moreover, such hot Spots can be excited with a broad range of wavelengths (although the pattern of hot spots is critically wavelength dependent). Recently, reports have been published suggesting SERS enhancements upwards of 1014, sufficient for single molecule SERS detection. Although the cause of such huge enhancements was at first mysterious, we suggest that these observations result from the aforementioned electromagnetic effects in aggregates combined with either intramolecular or metal-to-molecule (or molecule-tometal) resonances. We also Show that the purported optical pumping of vibrationally excited states by such intense SERS transitions is spurious.},

  abstract = {The success of density functional theory (DFT) is clearly demonstrated by the overwhelming amount of research articles describing results obtained within DFT that were published in the last decades. There is also a fair number of books reviewing the basics of the theory and its extensions (e.g., the present volume, [1] and [2]). These works fall mainly into three classes: those dealing with the theory (proposing extensions, new functionals, etc.), those concerned with the technical aspects of the numerical implementations, and others - the vast majority - presenting results. In our opinion, any scientist working in the field should have a sound knowledge of the three classes. For example, a theorist developing a new functional should be aware of the difficulties in implementing it. Or the applied scientist, performing calculations on specific systems, should know the limitations of the theory and of the numerical implementation she/he is using. The goal of this chapter is to supply the beginner with a brief pedagogical overview of DFT, combining the abovementioned aspects. However, we will not review its foundations - we redirect the reader to the chapter of J. Perdew and S. Kurth that opens this book. Obviously, we will not be able to provide many details, but we hope that the beginner obtains a general impression of the capabilities and limitations of DFT.},

The qualitative features of the spectra agree well with the exciton-coupling model and with previous experimental and theoretical results. In the end-to-end orientation, longitudinal peak red-shifts with decreasing distance. For side-by-side dimers, the transverse peak splits as the interparticle distance decreases due to symmetry-breaking, and the longitudinal peak blue-shifts slightly with decreasing distance. Quantum mechanical calculations are required for the calculation of absorption spectra at very short interparticle distances where the electron densities of the two subsystems overlap. At short distances, the energies and intensities of the monomer peaks change substantially and new excitation peaks emerge},

@ARTICLE{ab_298_1,
  abstract = {Fluorescence spectroscopy is a widely used research tool in biochemistry and molecular biology. Fluorescence has also become the dominant method enabling the revolution in medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and genomics. To date all the fluorescence observables, including spectral shifts, anisotropies, quantum yields, and lifetimes, have all been utilized in basic and applied uses of fluorescence. In this forward-looking article we describe a new opportunity in fluorescence, radiative decay engineering (RDE). By RDE we mean modifying the emission of fluorophores or chromophores by increasing or decreasing their radiative decay rates. In most fluorescence experiments the radiative rates are not changed because these rates depend on the extinction coefficient of the fluorophore. This intrinsic rate is not changed by quenching and is only weakly dependent on environmental effects. Spectral changes are usually caused by changes in the nonradiative rates resulting from quenching or resonance energy transfer. These processes affect the emission by providing additional routes for decay of the excited states without emission. In contrast to the relatively constant radiative rates in free solution, it is known that the radiative rates can be modified by placing the fluorophores at suitable distances from metallic surfaces and particles. This Review summarizes results from the physics literature which demonstrate the effects of metallic surfaces, colloids, or islands on increasing or decreasing emissive rates, increasing the quantum yields of low quantum yield chromophores, decreasing the lifetimes, and directing the typically isotropic emission in specific directions. These effects are not due to reflection of the emitted photons, but rather as the result of the fluorophore dipole interacting with free electrons in the metal. These interactions change the intensity and temporal and spatial distribution of the radiation. We describe the unusual effects expected from increases in the radiative rates with reference to intrinsic and extrinsic biochemical fluorophores. For instance, the decreased lifetime can result in an effective increase in photostability. Proximity to nearby metallic surfaces can also increase the local field and modify the rate of excitation. We predict that the appropriate localization of fluorophores near particles can result in usefully high emission from "nonfluorescent" molecules and million-fold increases in the number of photons observable from each fluorophore. We also describe how RDE can be applied to medical testing and biotechnology. As one example we predict that nearby metal surfaces can be used to increase the low intrinsic quantum yields of nucleic acids and make unlabeled DNA detectable using its intrinsic metal-enhanced fluorescence.},

@ARTICLE{ab_301_261,
  abstract = {Metallic surfaces can have unusual effects on fluorophores such as increasing or decreasing the rates of radiative decay and the rates of resonance energy transfer (RET). In the present article we describe the effects of metallic silver island films on the emission spectra, lifetimes, and energy transfer for several fluorophores. The fluorophores are not covalently coupled to the silver islands so that there are a range of fluorophore-to-metal distances. We show that proximity of fluorophores to the silver islands results in increased fluorescence intensity, with the largest enhancement for the lowest-quantum-yield fluorophores. Importantly, the metal-induced increases in intensity are accompanied by decreased lifetimes and increased photostability. These effects demonstrate that the silver islands have increased the radiative decay rates of the fluorophore. For solvent-sensitive fluorophores the emission spectra shifted to shorted wavelengths in the presence of the silver islands, which is consistent with a decrease of the apparent lifetime for fluorophores near the metal islands. We also observed an increased intensity and blue spectral shift for the protein human glyoxalase, which displays a low quantum yield for its intrinsic tryptophan emission. In this case the blue shift is thought to be due to increased emission from a buried low-quantum-yield tryptophan residue. Increased intensities were also observed for the intrinsic emission of the nucleic acid bases adenine and thymine and for single-stranded 15-mers poly(T) and poly(C). And finally, we observed increased RET for donors and acceptors in solution and when bound to double-helical DNA. These results demonstrate that metallic particles can be used to modify the emission from intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores in biochemical systems.},

@ARTICLE{ab_324_153,
  abstract = {A new method of fluorescence detection that promises to increase sensitivity by 20- to 1000-fold is described. This method will also decrease the contribution of sample autofluorescence to the detected signal. The method depends on the coupling of excited fluorophores with the surface plasmon resonance present in thin metal films, typically silver and gold. The phenomenon of surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) occurs for fluorophores 20-250 nm from the metal surface, allowing detection of fluorophores over substantial distances beyond the metal-sample interface. SPCE depends on interactions of the excited fluorophore with the metal surface. This interaction is independent of the mode of excitation; that is, it does not require evanescent wave or surface-plasmon excitation. In a sense, SPCE is the inverse process of the surface plasmon resonance absorption of thin metal films. Importantly, SPCE occurs over a narrow angular distribution, converting normally isotropic emission into easily collected directional emission. Up to 50% of the emission from unoriented samples can be collected, much larger than typical fluorescence collection efficiencies near 1% or less. SPCE is due only to fluorophores near the metal surface and may be regarded as emission from the induced surface plasmons. Autofluorescence from more distal parts of the sample is decreased due to decreased coupling. SPCE is highly polarized and autofluorescence can be further decreased by collecting only the polarized component or only the light propagating with the appropriate angle. Examples showing how simple optical configurations can be used in diagnostics, sensing, or biotechnology applications are presented. Surface plasmon-coupled emission is likely to find widespread applications throughout the biosciences.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence is typically isotropic in space and collected with low efficiency. In this paper we describe surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE), which displays unique optical properties and can be collected with an efficiency near 50%. SPCE occurs for fluorophores within about 200 nm of a thin metallic film, in our case a 50-nm-thick silver film on a glass substrate. We show that fluorophore proximity to this film converts the normally isotropic emission into highly directional emission through the glass substrate at a well-defined angle from the normal axis. Depending on the thickness of the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film on the silver, the coupling efficiency of sulforhodamine 101 in PVA ranged from 30 to 49%. Directional SPCE was observed whether the fluorophore was excited directly or by the evanescent field due to the surface plasmon resonance. The emission is always polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence, irrespective of the polarization of the incident light. The lifetimes are not substantially changed, indicating a mechanism somewhat different from that observed previously for the effects of silver particles on fluorophores. Remarkably, the directional emission shows intrinsic spectral resolution because the coupling angles depend on wavelength. The distances over which SPCE occurs, 10 to 200 nm, are useful because a large number of fluorophores can be localized within this volume. The emission of more distant fluorophores does not couple into the glass, allowing background suppression from biological samples. SPCE can be expected to become rapidly useful in a variety of analytical and medical sensing applications.},

  abstract = {Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and complex optical properties. Examples include the intense colors of noble metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited fluorophores near the metal surfaces. Recently, the interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain increased fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to predict whether a particular metal structure, such as a colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or enhance fluorescence. In the present report we suggest how the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons (RPs). The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is simple to understand. According to the RP model, the emission or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can be predicted from the optical properties of the metal structures as calculated from electrodynamics, Mie theory, and/or Maxwell's equations. For example, according to Mie theory and the size and shape of the particle, the extinction of metal colloids can be due to either absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated by absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering. Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench fluorescence because absorption is dominant over scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance fluorescence because the scattering component is dominant over absorption. The ability of a metal's surface to absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching requirements at the metal-sample interface. Wavenumber matching considerations can also be used to predict whether fluorophores at a given distance from a continuous planar surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations suggest that the so called "lossy surface waves" which quench fluorescence are due to induced electron oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost by lossy surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model provides a rational approach for designing fluorophore-metal configurations with the desired emissive properties and a basis for nanophotonic fluorophore technology.},

  abstract = {The critical importance of the junction between touching or closely adjacent Ag nanoparticles associated with single-molecule sensitivity (SMS) in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was confirmed via the following observations: (1) an additional peak is observed in elastic scattering only for the SERS-active state, which originated from absorption of adsorbates, (2) local- and far-field evaluation using a finite difference time domain method could reproduce this extra peak and anticipate the significantly enhanced field even inside the adsorbates sitting at the junction through an increased coupling of the localized surface plasmons, and (3) in addition to enhanced fluorescence of adsorbed dye, an inelastic scattering peak was observed and attributed to the metal surface electron. Concerning the chemical enhancement in SERS, Cl$^-$ anions activate the Ag-Cl-R6G (rhodamine) samples by inducing intrinsic electronic interaction between Ag and R6G molecules. This electronic interaction is irreversibly quenched by the addition of thiosulfate anions which dissolve Ag+ cations while the electromagnetic (EM) effect remains intact.},

  abstract = {Finite element method calculations were carried out to determine extinction spectra and the electromagnetic (EM) contributions to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for 90-nm Au nanoparticle dimers modeled after experimental nanotags. The calculations revealed that the EM properties depend significantly on the junction region, specifically the distance between the nanoparticles for spacings of less than 1 nm. For extinction spectra, spacings below 1 nm lead to maxima that are strongly red-shifted from the 600-nm plasmon maximum associated with an isolated nanoparticle. This result agrees qualitatively well with experimental transmission electron microscopy images and localized surface plasmon resonance spectra that are also presented. The calculations further revealed that spacings below 0.5 nm, and especially a slight fusing of the nanoparticles to give tiny crevices, leads to EM enhancements of 1010 or greater. Assuming a uniform coating of SERS molecules around both nanoparticles, we determined that regardless of the separation, the highest EM fields always dominate the SERS signal. In addition, we determined that for small separations less than 3% of the molecules always contribute to greater than 90% of the signal.},

Two-photon absorption has important advantages over conventional one-photon absorption, which has led to applications in microscopy, microfabrication, three-dimensional data storage, optical power limiting, up-converted lasing, photodynamic therapy, and for the localized release of bio-active species. These applications have generated a demand for new dyes with high two-photon absorption cross-sections.

Today, many of the soluble larger carben can be purchased either in pure form or as isomeric mixtures. In particular, pure C70 is available in preparative amounts from fullerene soot without the need for tedious separation by high-performance liquid chromatography; this has had a major impact on the progress of the chemistry of this higher fullerene. Over the last years C70 has been functionalized in many ways, and pure derivatives of even the larger, more complex carbon spheres C76, C84, and recently also C78, have been isolated and characterized. From the collected body of data, first general principles of reactivity and selectivity begin to emerge for these fullerenes, which are all less symmetric than C60. Important information is provided by multiple additions to higher fullerenes, in which certain isomers are formed with a remarkable selectivity that exceedes that observed for C60. A particularly attractive aspect is the chirality of certain allotropes and many derivatives. Although the chirality of fullerene derivatives is not restricted to the larger carbon cages, it was sofar mostly explored through their chemistry and can be related to different structural characteristics. A recently proposed system allows simple specification by a single descriptor of the configuration of chiral fullerenes and fullerene derivatives with a chiral functionalization pattern, including highly branched carbon frameworks with a multitude of possible stereogenic centers.},

@ARTICLE{acr_41_157,
  abstract = {Although density functional theory is widely used in the computational chemistry community, the most popular density functional, B3LYP, has some serious shortcomings: (i) it is better for main-group chemistry than for transition metals; (ii) it systematically underestimates reaction barrier heights; (iii) it is inaccurate for interactions dominated by medium-range correlation energy, such as van der Waals attraction, aromatic−aromatic stacking, and alkane isomerization energies. We have developed a variety of databases for testing and designing new density functionals. We used these data to design new density functionals, called M06-class (and, earlier, M05-class) functionals, for which we enforced some fundamental exact constraints such as the uniform-electron-gas limit and the absence of self-correlation energy. Our M06-class functionals depend on spin-up and spin-down electron densities (i.e., spin densities), spin density gradients, spin kinetic energy densities, and, for nonlocal (also called hybrid) functionals, Hartree−Fock exchange. We have developed four new functionals that overcome the above-mentioned difficulties: (a) M06, a hybrid meta functional, is a functional with good accuracy ``across-the-board'' for transition metals, main group thermochemistry, medium-range correlation energy, and barrier heights; (b) M06-2X, another hybrid meta functional, is not good for transition metals but has excellent performance for main group chemistry, predicts accurate valence and Rydberg electronic excitation energies, and is an excellent functional for aromatic−aromatic stacking interactions; (c) M06-L is not as accurate as M06 for barrier heights but is the most accurate functional for transition metals and is the only local functional (no Hartree−Fock exchange) with better across-the-board average performance than B3LYP; this is very important because only local functionals are affordable for many demanding applications on very large systems; (d) M06-HF has good performance for valence, Rydberg, and charge transfer excited states with minimal sacrifice of ground-state accuracy. In this Account, we compared the performance of the M06-class functionals and one M05-class functional (M05-2X) to that of some popular functionals for diverse databases and their performance on several difficult cases. The tests include barrier heights, conformational energy, and the trend in bond dissociation energies of Grubbs ruthenium catalysts for olefin metathesis. Based on these tests, we recommend (1) the M06-2X, BMK, and M05-2X functionals for main-group thermochemistry and kinetics, (2) M06-2X and M06 for systems where main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions are all important, (3) M06-L and M06 for transition metal thermochemistry, (4) M06 for problems involving multireference rearrangements or reactions where both organic and transition-metal bonds are formed or broken, (5) M06-2X, M05-2X, M06-HF, M06, and M06-L for the study of noncovalent interactions, (6) M06-HF when the use of full Hartree−Fock exchange is important, for example, to avoid the error of self-interaction at long-range, (7) M06-L when a local functional is required, because a local functional has much lower cost for large systems.},

Unfortunately, the lack of reliable and reproducible fabrication methods limited its applicability. In recent years, SERS has enjoyed a renaissance, and there is renewed interest in both the fundamentals and applications of SERS. New techniques for nanofabrication, the design of substrates that maximize the electromagnetic enhancement, and the discovery of single-molecule SERS are driving the resurgence of this field. This Account highlights our group's recent work on SERS. Initially, we discuss SERS substrates that have shown proven reproducibility, stability, and large field enhancement. These substrates enable many analytical applications, such as anthrax detection, chemical warfare agent stimulant detection, and in vitro and in vivo glucose sensing. We then turn to a detailed study of the wavelength and distance dependence of SERS, which further illustrate predictions obtained from the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism. Last, an isotopic labeling technique applied to the rhodamine 6G (R6G)/silver system serves as an additional proof of the existence of single-molecule SERS and explores the dynamical features of this process. This work, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, allows us to comment on the possible role of charge transfer in the R6G/silver system.},

These methods have proven to be immensely useful in recent years for interpreting a wide range of nanoscience experiments and providing the capability to describe optical properties of particles up to several hundred nanometers in dimension, including arbitrary particle structures and complex dielectric environments (adsorbed layers of molecules, nearby metal films, and other particles). While some of the methods date back to Mie's celebrated work a century ago, others are still at the forefront of algorithm development in computational electromagnetics. This Account gives a qualitative description of the physical and mathematical basis behind the most commonly used methods, including both analytical and numerical methods, as well as representative results of applications that are relevant to current experiments. The analytical methods that we discuss are either derived from Mie theory for spheres or from the quasistatic (Gans) model as applied to spheres and spheroids. In this discussion, we describe the use of Mie theory to determine electromagnetic contributions to SERS enhancements that include for retarded dipole emission effects, and the use of the quasistatic approximation for spheroidal particles interacting with dye adsorbate layers. The numerical methods include the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the finite element method (FEM) based on Whitney forms. We discuss applications such as using DDA to describe the interaction of two gold disks to define electromagnetic hot spots, FDTD for light interacting with metal wires that go from particle-like plasmonic response to the film-like transmission as wire dimension is varied, and FEM studies of electromagnetic fields near cubic particles.},

@ARTICLE{acr_41_1742,
  abstract = {The excited electronic states of noble metal Au and Ag nanocrystals are very different than those of molecules. Ag and Au nanocrystal optical transitions (plasmons) in the visible can be so intense that they significantly modify the local electromagnetic field. Also, coherent elastic Rayleigh light scattering is stronger than normal electronic absorption of photons for larger nanocrystals. These two facts make Au and Ag nanocrystals ideal nanoantennas, in that they focus incident light into the local neighborhood of subwavelength size. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), in which the Raman scattering rate of nearby molecules increases by many orders of magnitude, is a consequence of this nanoantenna effect. Metallic nanocrystals also have no band gap; this makes them extraordinarily polarizable. Their electronic transitions sense the local environment. An extreme case is the interaction of two 30 nm Ag nanocrystals separated by a 1 nm gap. Their mutual polarization completely transforms the nature of the metallic excited electronic state. Single particles have an excited state uniformly distributed throughout the interior, while the nanocrystal dimer has its excited state localized on the metal surface in the junction. This creates an electromagnetic "hot spot" in the junction, enabling the observation of single-molecule SERS. The fact that surface molecules are typically chemisorbed and exchange electrons with the metal has interesting chemical consequences. First, the enhanced Raman intensities are controlled by quantum mechanical coupling of the molecular lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with the optically excited electrons in the metal. Second, charge-transfer photochemistry can result from metal plasmon excitation. In crystalline Ag nanocrystals the photochemistry quantum yield can be high because the nanocrystal surface dominates plasmon nonradiative relaxation. Colloidal Ag nanocrystals stabilized by sodium citrate build up a photovoltage under visible excitation, caused by irreversible "hot hole" photo-oxidation of adsorbed citrate anion. This creates a driving force for photochemical transformation of round 8 nm Ag seeds into 70 nm single-crystal disk prisms under room lights, in a novel type of light-driven Ostwald ripening.},

  abstract = {Much of the current excitement surrounding nanoscience is directly connected to the promise of new nanoscale applications in cancer diagnostics and therapy. Because of their strongly resonant light-absorbing and light-scattering properties that depend on shape, noble metal nanoparticles provide a new and powerful tool for innovative light-based approaches. Nanoshells?spherical, dielectric core, gold shell nanoparticles?have been central to the development of photothermal cancer therapy and diagnostics for the past several years. By manipulating nanoparticle shape, researchers can tune the optical resonance of nanoshells to any wavelength of interest. At wavelengths just beyond the visible spectrum in the near-infrared, blood and tissue are maximally transmissive. When nanoshell resonances are tuned to this region of the spectrum, they become useful contrast agents in the diagnostic imaging of tumors. When illuminated, they can serve as nanoscale heat sources, photothermally inducing cell death and tumor remission. As nanoshell-based diagnostics and therapeutics move from laboratory studies to clinical trials, this Account examines the highly promising achievements of this approach in the context of the challenges of this complex disease. More broadly, these materials present a concrete example of a highly promising application of nanochemistry to a biomedical problem. We describe the properties of nanoshells that are relevant to their preparation and use in cancer diagnostics and therapy. Specific surface chemistries are necessary for passive uptake of nanoshells into tumors and for targeting specific cell types by bioconjugate strategies. We also describe the photothermal temperature increases that can be achieved in surrogate structures known as tissue phantoms and the accuracy of models of this effect using heat transport analysis. Nanoshell-based photothermal therapy in several animal models of human tumors have produced highly promising results, and we include nanoparticle dosage information, thermal response, and tumor outcomes for these experiments. Using immunonanoshells, infrared diagnostic imaging contrast enhancement and photothermal therapy have been integrated into a single procedure. Finally, we examine a novel ?Trojan horse? strategy for nanoparticle delivery that overcomes the challenge of accessing and treating the hypoxic regions of tumors, where blood flow is minimal or nonexistent. The ability to survive hypoxia selects aggressive cells which are likely to be the source of recurrence and metastasis. Treatment of these regions has been incredibly difficult. Ultimately, we look beyond the current research and assess the next challenges as nanoshell-based photothermal cancer therapy is implemented in clinical practice.},

@ARTICLE{acr_42_734,
  abstract = {In the late 1970s, signal intensity in Raman spectroscopy was found to be enormously enhanced, by a factor of 106 and more recently by as much as 1014, when an analyte was placed in the vicinity of a metal nanoparticle (particularly Ag). The underlying source of this huge increase in signal in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy has since been characterized by considerable controversy. Three possible contributions to the enhancement factor have been identified: (i) the surface plasmon resonance in the metal nanoparticle, (ii) a charge-transfer resonance involving transfer of electrons between the molecule and the conduction band of the metal, and (iii) resonances within the molecule itself. These three components are often treated as independently contributing to the overall effect, with the implication that by properly choosing the experimental parameters, one or more can be ignored. Although varying experimental conditions can influence the relative degree to which each resonance influences the total enhancement, higher enhancements can often be obtained by combining two or more resonances. Each resonance has a somewhat different effect on the appearance of the resulting Raman spectrum, and it is necessary to invoke one or more of these resonances to completely describe a particular experiment. However, it is impossible to completely describe all observations of the SERS phenomenon without consideration of all three of these contributions. Furthermore, the relative enhancements of individual spectral lines, and therefore the appearance of the spectrum, depend crucially on the exact extent to which each resonance makes a contribution. In this Account, by examining breakdowns in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we have used Herzberg-Teller coupling to derive a single expression for SERS, which includes contributions from all three resonances. Moreover, we show that these three types of resonances are intimately linked by Herzberg-Teller vibronic coupling terms and cannot be considered separately. We also examine the differences between SERS and normal Raman spectra. Because of the various resonant contributions, SERS spectra vary with excitation wavelength considerably more than normal Raman spectra. The relative contributions of totally symmetric and non-totally symmetric lines are also quite different; these differences are due to several effects. The orientation of the molecule with respect to the surface and the inclusion of the metal Fermi level in the list of contributors to the accessible states of the molecule-metal system have a strong influence on the observed changes in the Raman spectrum.},

  abstract = {Recently, dye-sensitized solar cells have attracted much attention relevant to global environmental issues. Thus far, ruthenium(II) bipyridyl complexes have proven to be the most efficient TiO2 sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells. However, a gradual increment in the highest power conversion efficiency has been recognized in the past decade. More importantly, considering that ruthenium is a rare metal, novel dyes without metal or using inexpensive metal are desirable for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. Large \pi-aromatic molecules, such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and perylenes, are important classes of potential sensitizers for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells, owing to their photostability and high light-harvesting capabilities that can allow applications in thinner, low-cost dye-sensitized solar cells. Porphyrins possess an intense Soret band at 400 nm and moderate Q bands at 600 nm. Nevertheless, the poor light-harvesting properties relative to the ruthenium complexes have limited the cell performance of porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 cells. Elongation of the \pi-aromatic conjugation and loss of symmetry in porphyrins cause broadening and a red shift of the absorption bands together with an increasing intensity of the Q bands relative to that of the Soret band. On the basis of the strategy, the cell performance of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells has been improved intensively by the enhanced light absorption. Actually, some push-pull-type porphyrins have disclosed a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (6-7%) that was close to that of the ruthenium complexes. Phthalocyanines exhibit strong absorption around 300 and 700 nm and redox features that are similar to porphyrins. Moreover, phthalocyanines are transparent over a large region of the visible spectrum, thereby enabling the possibility of using them as ``photovoltaic windows.'' However, the cell performance was poor, owing to strong aggregation and lack of directionality in the excited state. Novel unsymmetrical zinc phthalocyanine sensitizers with ``push'' and ``pull'' groups have made it possible to reduce the aggregation on a TiO2 surface, tune the level of the excited state, and strengthen the electronic coupling between the phthalocyanine core and the TiO2 surface. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of up to 3.5% has been achieved. Perylenes are well-known as chemically, thermally, and photophysically stable dyes and have been used in various optical devices and applications. Nevertheless, the power conversion efficiency remained low compared to other organic dyes. The origin of such limited cell performance is the poor electron-donating abilities of the perylenes, which makes it difficult to inject electrons from the excited singlet state of the perylenes to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode efficiently. Strongly electron-donating perylene carboxylic acid derivatives with amine substituents at their perylene core have allowed us to increase the power conversion efficiency of up to $\sim$7% in perylene-sensitized solar cells. The efficiency of large \pi-aromatic molecule-sensitized solar cells could be improved significantly if the dyes with larger red and near-infrared absorption could be developed.},

  abstract = {Organic dyes extracted from plants, insects, and shellfish have been used for millennia in dyeing textiles and manufacturing colorants for painting. The economic push for dyes with high tinting strength, directly related to high extinction coefficients in the visible range, historically led to the selection of substances that could be used at low concentrations. But a desirable property for the colorist is a major problem for the analytical chemist; the identification of dyes in cultural heritage objects is extremely difficult. Techniques routinely used in the identification of inorganic pigments are generally not applicable to dyes: X-ray fluorescence because of the lack of an elemental signature, Raman spectroscopy because of the generally intense luminescence of dyes, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy because of the interference of binders and extenders. Traditionally, the identification of dyes has required relatively large samples (0.5-5 mm in diameter) for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography. In this Account, we describe our efforts to develop practical approaches in identifying dyes in works of art from samples as small as 25 m in diameter with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). In SERS, the Raman scattering signal is greatly enhanced when organic molecules with large delocalized electron systems are adsorbed on atomically rough metallic substrates; fluorescence is concomitantly quenched. Recent nanotechnological advances in preparing and manipulating metallic particles have afforded staggering enhancement factors of up to 1014. SERS is thus an ideal technique for the analysis of dyes. Indeed, rhodamine 6G and crystal violet, two organic compounds used to demonstrate the sensitivity of SERS at the single-molecule level, were first synthesized as textile dyes in the second half of the 19th century. In this Account, we examine the practical application of SERS to cultural heritage studies, including the selection of appropriate substrates, the development of analytical protocols, and the building of SERS spectral databases. We also consider theoretical studies on dyes of artistic interest. Using SERS, we have successfully documented the earliest use of a madder lake pigment and the earliest occurrence of lac dye in European art. We have also found several examples of kermes and cochineal glazes, as well as madder, cochineal, methyl violet, and eosin lakes, from eras ranging from ancient Egypt to the 19th century. The ability to rapidly analyze very small samples with SERS makes it a particularly valuable tool in a museum context.},

  abstract = {Efficient solar energy conversion has been vigorously pursued since the 1970s, but its large-scale implementation hinges on the availability of high-efficiency modules. For maximum efficiency, it is important to absorb most of the incoming radiation, which necessitates both efficient photoexcitation and minimal electron?hole recombination. To date, researchers have primarily focused on the latter difficulty: finding a strategy to effectively separate photoinduced electrons and holes. Very few reports have been devoted to broadband sunlight absorption and photoexcitation. However, the currently available photovoltaic cells, such as amorphous silicon, and even single-crystal silicon and sensitized solar cells, cannot respond to the wide range of the solar spectrum. The photoelectric conversion characteristics of solar cells generally decrease in the infrared wavelength range. Thus, the fraction of the solar spectrum absorbed is relatively poor. In addition, the large mismatch between the diffraction limit of light and the absorption cross-section makes the probability of interactions between photons and cell materials quite low, which greatly limits photoexcitation efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing need for research aimed at finding conditions that lead to highly efficient photoexcitation over a wide spectrum of sunlight, particularly in the visible to near-infrared wavelengths. As characterized in the emerging field of plasmonics, metallic nanostructures are endowed with optical antenna effects.

  abstract = {Recent advances in nanoscience and biomedicine have expanded our ability to design and construct multifunctional nanoparticles that combine targeting, therapeutic, and diagnostic functions within a single nanoscale complex. The theranostic capabilities of gold nanoshells, spherical nanoparticles with silica cores and gold shells, have attracted tremendous attention over the past decade as nanoshells have emerged as a promising tool for cancer therapy and bioimaging enhancement. This Account examines the design and synthesis of nanoshell-based theranostic agents, their plasmon-derived optical properties, and their corresponding applications. We discuss the design and preparation of nanoshell complexes and their ability to enhance the photoluminescence of fluorophores while maintaining their properties as MR contrast agents. In this Account, we discuss the underlying physical principles that contribute to the photothermal response of nanoshells. We then elucidate the photophysical processes that induce nanoshells to enhance the fluorescence of weak near-infrared fluorophores. Nanoshells illuminated with resonant light are either strong optical absorbers or scatterers, properties that give rise to their unique capabilities. These physical processes have been harnessed to visualize and eliminate cancer cells. We describe the application of nanoshells as a contrast agent for optical coherence tomography of breast carcinoma cells in vivo. Our recent studies examine nanoshells as a multimodal theranostic probe, using these nanoparticles for near-infrared fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and for the photothermal ablation of cancer cells. Multimodal nanoshells show theranostic potential for imaging subcutaneous breast cancer tumors in animal models and the distribution of tumors in various tissues. Nanoshells also show promise as light-triggered gene therapy vectors, adding temporal control to the spatial control characteristic of nanoparticle-based gene therapy approaches. We describe the fabrication of DNA-conjugated nanoshell complexes and compare the efficiency of light-induced and thermally-induced release of DNA. Double-stranded DNA nanoshells also provide a way to deliver small molecules into cells: we describe the delivery and light-triggered release of DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), a dye molecule used to stain DNA in the nuclei of cells.},

Reversible modulation, moderate damping, and almost total quenching of the localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance is achieved as a function of the thickness of the CP layer and the potential applied to the electrochemical systems, that is, the charge carrier density injected into the CP layer. These experimental results can be qualitatively reproduced using the single-particle model in the electrostatic approximation.

  abstract = {The atomic structures of bare gold clusters provide the foundation to understand the enhanced catalytic properties of supported gold nanoparticles. However, the richness of diverse structures and the strong relativistic effects have posed considerable challenges for a systematic understanding of gold clusters with more than 20 atoms. We use photoelectron spectroscopy of size-selected anions, in combination with first principles calculations, to elucidate the structures of gold nanoclusters in a critical size regime from 55 to 64 atoms (1.1--1.3 nm in diameter). Au55 is found to be a nonicosahedral disordered cluster as a result of relativistic effects that induce strong surface contractions analogous to bulk surface reconstructions, whereas low-symmetry core-shell-type structures are found for Au56 to Au64. Au58 exhibits a major electron-shell closing and is shown to possess a low-symmetry, but nearly spherical structure with a large energy gap. Clear spectroscopic and computational evidence has been observed, showing that Au58 is a highly robust cluster and additional atoms are simply added to its surface from Au59 to Au64 without inducing significant structural changes. The unique low-symmetry structures characteristic of gold nanoclusters due to the strong relativistic effects allow abundant surface defects sites, providing a key structure--function relationship to understand the catalytic capabilities of gold nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Defined nanoparticle cluster arrays (NCAs) with total lateral dimensions of up to 25.4 micron x 25.4 micron have been fabricated on top of a 10 nm thin gold film using template-guided self-assembly. This approach provides precise control of the structural parameters in the arrays, allowing a systematic variation of the average number of nanoparticles in the clusters (n) and the edge-to-edge separation (lambda) between 1 < n < 20 and 50 nm <= lambda <= 1000 nm, respectively. Investigations of the Rayleigh scattering spectra and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal intensities as a function of n and lambda reveal direct near-field coupling between the particles within individual clusters, whose strength increases with the cluster size (n) until it saturates at around n = 4. Our analysis shows that strong near-field interactions between individual clusters significantly affect the SERS signal enhancement for edge-to-edge separations lambda < 200 nm. The observed dependencies of the Raman signals on n and lambda indicate that NCAs support a multiscale signal enhancement which originates from simultaneous inter- and intracluster coupling and |E|-field enhancement. The NCAs provide strong and reproducible SERS signals not only from small molecules but also from whole bacterial cells, which enabled a rapid spectral discrimination between three tested bacteria species: Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.},

Its Raman spectrum is well-known, graphene samples are entirely reproducible, height controllable down to the atomic scale, and can be made virtually defect-free. We report SERS from graphene, by depositing arrays of Au particles of well-defined dimensions on a graphene/SiO2 (300 nm)/Si system. We detect significant enhancements at 633 nm. To elucidate the physics of SERS, we develop a quantitative analytical and numerical theory. The 2d nature of graphene allows for a closed-form description of the Raman enhancement, in agreement with experiments. We show that this scales with the nanoparticle cross section, the fourth power of the Mie enhancement, and is inversely proportional to the tenth power of the separation between graphene and the center of the nanoparticle. One important consequence is that metallic nanodisks are an ideal embodiment for SERS in 2d.},

  abstract = { We studied the modulation of Raman scattering intensities of molecules on graphene by tuning the graphene Fermi level with electrical field effect (EFE). A series of metal phthalocyanine (M-Pc) molecules (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), which have different molecular energy levels, were used as probe molecules. The Raman intensities of all these M-Pc molecules become weaker when the graphene Fermi level is up-shifted by applying a positive gate voltage, while they become stronger when the graphene Fermi level is down-shifted by applying a negative gate voltage. However, this Raman intensity modulation only occurs when applying the gate voltage with a fast sweep rate, while it is nearly absent when applying the gate voltage with a slow sweep rate, which is likely due to the arising of the hysteresis effect in the graphene EFE. In addition, the Raman modulation ability for M-Pc molecules with smaller energy gaps is larger than that with larger energy gaps due to the difference in the energy alignment between graphene and these M-Pc molecules. Furthermore, this modulation shows the greatest one on single-layer graphene and mainly comes from the first layer of molecules which are in direct contact with graphene. The Raman modulation of molecules in GERS with the EFE suggests that the Raman enhancement for GERS occurs through a chemical enhancement mechanism. },

  abstract = {Monitoring changes in ultraviolet-visible (U-V-vis) absorption is not a viable method to process information for photochromic memory media due to the readout signal interfering with the photochromism. Only by monitoring the changes in other photophysical properties accompanying the photoisomerization reaction (refractive index, optical rotation, or luminescence, for example) can non-destructive, all photon-mode photochromic memory be realized. We have investigated several such systems based on 1,2-dithienylcyclopentene derivatives, which have a backbone that we consider to be currently the most promising of the photochromes. The two readout signals highlighted in this article are luminescence and optical rotation. The luminescent systems rely on porphyrinic chromophores tethered to the photochrome directly or through dative bonds. When the macrocycles are irradiated with light at wavelengths outside the absorption range of the photochrome, luminescence is only observed when the 1,2-dithienylcyclopentene backbone exists in its open-state. The self-assembly of a chiral photochromic metallo-helicate allows for stereoselective ring-closing of the 1,2-dithienylcyclopentene backbone providing a change in optical rotation that can be used as a readout signal. In the article, we also describe the use of ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) to fabricate well-ordered photochromic homopolymers possessing identical photochromic properties as their monomers.},

  abstract = {A comparative study of the two-photon absorption (TPA) properties of octupolar compounds and their dipolar one-dimensional counterparts is presented on the basis of correlated quantum-chemical calculations. The roles of dimensionality and symmetry are first discussed on the basis of a simple exciton picture where the ground-state and excited-state wavefunctions of three-arm octupolar systems are built from a linear combination of the corresponding single-arm wavefunctions. This model predicts a factor of 3 increase in the TPA cross section in the limiting case of three independent charge-transfer pathways. When taking into account the full chemical structures of representative octupolar molecules, the results of the calculations indicate that a much larger enhancement associated with an increase in dimensionality and delocalization can be achieved when the core of the chromophore allows significant electronic coupling among the individual arms. These theoretical predictions are in agreement with the experimental determination of the TPA cross sections for crystal violet and the related compound, brilliant green, and suggest new strategies for the design of conjugated materials with large TPA cross sections.},

  abstract = {Based on the Ehrenfest theorem, an equation-of-motion that takes relaxation into account has been presented in wave function theory, and the resulting response functions are non-divergent in the off-resonant as well as the resonant regions of the spectrum. The derivation of the linear and first-order nonlinear response functions includes exact state theory as well as single determinant approximate state theory thereby including time-dependent Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham theories. The response functions in this theory are complex and the methodology is coined the complex polarization propagator technique. The real and imaginary parts of the response functions may correspond to different physical observables. The present work includes applications that involve electric- and magnetic-dipole molecular properties in the visible, ultra-violet, and X-ray regions of the frequency spectrum. The real and imaginary parts of the electric-dipole polarizability and the mixed electric-dipole-magnetic-dipole polarizability are determined for S-methyl oxirane in order to calculate the polarizability, linear absorption cross section, optical rotatory dispersion, and electronic circular dichroism. The linear absorption cross section is determined in the ultra-violet region and at the carbon K-edge. The polarizability with an imaginary frequency argument is determined for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and methyl oxirane and the related C6, dispersion interaction coefficients are determined from the Casimir-Polder integral. As a single application of the nonlinear response function, the two-photon resonant enhanced second-harmonic generation response is determined for a ``two-dimensional'' pi-conjugated system.},

Formulas are given for the evaluation of extinction, absorption, scattering, and polarization cross sections. A simple numerical algorithm based on the method of conjugate gradients is found to provide an efficient and robust method for obtaining accurate solutions to the scattering problem. The method works well for absorptive, as well as dielectric, grain materials. Two validity criteria for the DDA are presented. The DDA is then used to compute extinction cross sections for spherical graphite grains and to calculate extinction cross sections for nonspherical graphite grains with three different geometries. It is concluded that the interstellar 2175 A extinction feature could be produced by small graphite grains which should have aspect ratios not far from unity.},

An example is the changes in the intrinsic symmetry of Raman tensors in molecules produced by resonance or near-resonance conditions. Many of these effects can be obtained from commercial and open source programs that solve the electronic structure of the molecules with density functional theory and compute the Raman tensors of the vibrations. The origin of these changes is hidden by the complexity of these calculations and by the many intermediate computational steps that are not presented to the user. We discuss a simplified model for the electronic structure of a molecule and correlate what is observed with a calculation using density functional theory for a specific molecule. The model yields insight into resonance phenomena, symmetry-related aspects of Raman tensors, and the microscopic origin of the Raman effect itself.},

  abstract = {Electronic memory devices having the indium-tin oxide/polymer/Al sandwich structure were fabricated from polymers containing pendant azobenzene chromophores in donor-acceptor structures. The reversibility, or rewritability, of the high-conductivity (ON) state was found to be dependant on the terminal moiety of the azobenzene chromophore. While the polymers with electron-accepting terminal moieties (-Br or -NO2) in the pendant azobenzene exhibit write-once, read-many-times (WORM) type memory behavior, those with electron-donating terminal moieties (-OCH3) exihibit rewritable (FLASH) memory behavior. The WORM memory devices have low switching (``write'') voltages below -2 V and high ON/OFF current ratios of about 104-106. The polarity of the ``write'' voltage can be reversed by using an electrode with a higher work function than Al, thus excluding metallic filamentary conduction as a cause of the bistable switching phenomenon. The FLASH memory devices have low ``write'' and ``erase'' voltages of about -1.7 to -1.8 V and 2.0 to 2.2 V, respectively, and ON/OFF current ratios of about 103-104. The electrical bistability observed can be attributed to charge trapping at the azobenzene chromophores, resulting in the charge-separated, high-conductivity state. The proposed mechanism is supported experimentally by a red shift and peak broadening in the UV-visible absorption spectra of the polymer films resulting from the OFF-to-ON electrical transition.},

Until recently, essentially all fluorescence experiments were performed using optical energy which has radiated to the far-field. By far-field we mean at least several wavelengths from the fluorophore, but propagating far-field radiation is usually detected at larger macroscopic distances from the sample. In recent years there has been a growing interest in the interactions of fluorophores with metallic surfaces or particles. Near-field interactions are those occurring within a wavelength distance of an excited fluorophore. The spectral properties of fluorophores can be dramatically altered by near-field interactions with the electron clouds present in metals. These interactions modify the emission in ways not seen in classical fluorescence experiments. In this review we provide an intuitive description of the complex physics of plasmons and near-field interactions. Additionally, we summarize the recent work on metal-fluorophore interactions and suggest how these effects will result in new classes of experimental procedures, novel probes, bioassays and devices.},

It relies on the use of two different Ru(bpy)32+-doped silica nanoparticles (Probe1,2RSNP and Probe2RSNP) coated with complementary DNAs, which can be simply and conveniently self-assembled to build sandwich-type dendritic architectures on a gold grid. The performance of this dendritic amplification route was demonstrated in conjunction with the electrogenerated chemiluminescent (ECL) detection of the target DNA. Compared to normal amplification, dendritic amplification allowed a 5-fold enhancement of the ECL signals. The higher sensitivity allowed by the dendritic amplification route was attributed to the hybridization between the DNA (Probe2DNA) on Probe1,2RSNP (normal amplification) and the complementary DNA (Probe2 DNA) on the additional Probe2RSNP. As low as 1 fM of 22-bp-long target DNA was clearly detected. The experimental results demonstrated that the ECL intensity achieved through dendritic amplification showed a good linear relationship with the concentration of the target DNA over a wide linear range (10 fM[similar]10 pM).},

The sensitivity of the reflection infrared spectroscopy at these surfaces is remarkably improved by evaporating very thin silver films on the sample surfaces. The same results were obtained also by casting thin organic films on metal-coated substrates. The improvement of the spectral sensitivity is due to the enhancement of the incident infrared field at the metal surfaces.

  abstract = {The detection of two-photon excited fluorescence is practically free from background caused by linear scattering because two-photon excited fluorescence occurs at a much shorter wavelength region than the excitation light. This property can be used to achieve ultrasensitive fluorescence detection. However, similar to linear scattering in the detection of one-photon excited fluorescence, the question arises whether background caused by nonlinear scattering may limit the detection sensitivity of two-photon excited fluorescence. In this work, quantitative comparisons between two-photon induced scattering of liquid water and two-photon excited dye fluorescence in a standard epifluorescence geometry show that the relative scattering background is typically reduced by orders of magnitude in two-photon excitation as compared to single-photon excitation with confocal detection. Hyper-Rayleigh and hyper-Raman (3400 cm-1) cross sections of liquid water have been measured to be 8 \texttimes 10-62 and 7 \texttimes 10-63 cm4\textperiodcentereds/photon, respectively, at 840 nm incident wavelength, with absolute values calibrated with respect to the known two-photon fluorescence excitation cross section of fluorescein.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence enhancement was studied on silver colloidal metal films (CMFs) using two systems: (1) Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers of fluorescein-labeled phospholipids separated from the surface of the films by spacer layers of octadecanoic acid and (2) biotin-fluorescein conjugates captured by avidin molecules adsorbed on top of a multilayer structure formed by alternating layers of bovine serum albumin-biotin conjugate (BSA-biotin) and avidin. The dependence of fluorescence intensity on the number of lipid or protein spacer layers deposited on the surface of the CMF was investigated. The results demonstrate the requirement for adsorbate location within the region between Ag particles for maximal enhancement. The density of avidin molecules on the surface of the BSA-biotin/avidin multilayers adsorbed on the CMF was also determined. A procedure for forming a rigid, uniform silica layer around the Ag particles on the CMF is described. The layer protects the particles from undesirable chemical reactions such as etching by halide ions, for example, and provides the requisite stability for bioanalytical applications. Colloidal films composed of Ag particles covered by 10-nm-thick silica layers were tested for fluorescence enhancement using goat immunoglobulin and a conjugate of rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin with 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoate. An enhancement factor of 20 was obtained.},

  abstract = {The photodecomposition products of Ru(bpy)32+ in water, in aqueous buffered solutions and encapsulated in zeolite-Y have been analyzed by chromatography and UV-visible spectroscopy. The chromatographic method is found to be capable of separating species with the same charge but slightly different ligands as well as geometrical isomers. In all the systems investigated, photodecomposition proceeded via photoaquation resulting in the formation of cis- and trans-Ru(bpy)2(OH2)22+. In the case of acetate and phthalate buffers, a third species, Ru(bpy)2(L)(OH2)+, where L is the buffer anion, was found to be the dominant product. For a given pH, the extent of decomposition was found to be dependent on both the buffer anion, following the trend, phosphate < acetate \^a\textordfeminine phthalate and buffer concentration. The presence of the electron-transfer quenching agent, N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium ion in the medium led to a decrease of the photodecomposition and closely followed the quenching efficiency as measured by intensity and lifetime quenching studies. Encapsulation of Ru(bpy)32+ in the supercages of zeolite-Y did not lead to a substantial decrease in photodecomposition as compared to an aqueous solution, suggesting that the expected enhanced stability of Ru(bpy)32+* due to the destabilization of 3dd orbitals and the cage effect was being negated by the close proximity and intrazeolite packing of H2O molecules around the Ru center.},

  abstract = {Time, cost, and casualties associated with demining efforts underscore the need for improved detection techniques. Reduction in the number of false positives by directly detecting the explosive material, rather than casing material, is desirable. The desired field sensor must, at a minimum, demonstrate reproducibility, the necessary level of sensitivity, portability, instrumental stability, and fast system response times. Ideally, vibrational spectroscopic techniques have the potential to remove false positives, since every chemical has a unique bond structure. Herein, we demonstrate the capabilities of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to detect the chemical vapor signature emanating from buried TNT-based landmines. We present reproducible results obtained from blind tests controlled by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that demonstrate vapor detection of 2,4-dinitrotoluene at concentration levels of 5 ppb or less. The results presented used acquisition times of 30 s on a fieldable system and showed that SERS can be a significant improvement over current landmine detection methods.},

The method relies on the change in the absorbance spectrum of a self-assembled monolayer of colloidal gold on glass, as a function of biomolecular binding to the surface of the immobilized colloids. Using this approach, we demonstrate proof of principle of a label-free optical biosensor to quantify biomolecular interactions in real time on a surface in a commercially available UV-visible spectrophotometer and of a colorimetric end-point assay using an optical scanner. The spectrophotometric sensor shows concentration-dependent binding and a detection limit of 16 nM for streptavidin. The sensor is easy to fabricate, is reproducible in its performance, has minimal technological requirements, namely, the availability of an UV-visible spectrophotometer or an optical scanner, and will enable high-throughput screening of biomolecular interactions in real time in an array-based format.},

  abstract = {This work updates the recent progress made toward fabricating a real-time, quantitative, and biocompatible glucose sensor based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The sensor design relies on an alkanethiolate tri(ethylene glycol) monolayer that acts as a partition layer, preconcentrating glucose near a SERS-active surface. Chemometric analysis of the captured SERS spectra demonstrates that glucose is quantitatively detected in the physiological concentration range (0450 mg/dL, 025 mM). In fact, 94\% of the predicted glucose concentrations fall within regions A and B of the Clarke error grid, making acceptable predictions in a clinically relevant range. The data presented herein also demonstrate that the glucose sensor provides stable SERS spectra for at least 3 days, making the SERS substrate a candidate for implantable sensing. Glucose sensor reversibility and reusability is evaluated as the sensor is alternately exposed to glucose and saline solutions; after each cycle, difference spectra reveal that the partitioning process is largely reversible. Finally, the SERS glucose sensor successfully partitions glucose even when challenged with bovine serum albumin, a serum protein mimic.},

This experiment demonstrated that it is possible to detect the chromophore in various matrixes of increasing complexity, allowing its unambiguous identification in a wide range of artists materials, even at very low concentration and in the presence of binders such as glue. In addition, removal of the colorant from the complex with the inorganic substrate or mordanted yarn was not necessary for identification. This proof-of-concept study was then extended to include analysis of several pastel sticks from a historical pastel box and two samples from a pastel artwork, both attributed to American painter Mary Cassatt (1844-1926).

  abstract = {A model for Raman scattering by a molecule adsorbed at the surface of a spherical particle is articulated by treating the molecule as a classical electric dipole. This follows Moskovits's suggestion [J. Chem. Phys. 69, 4159 (1978)] and the experiments by Creighton et al. [J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. II, 75, 790 (1979)] that such a system may exhibit SERS similar to that at roughened electrode surfaces. The molecule is stimulated by a primary field comprised of the incident and near-scattered fields. Emission consists of the dipole field plus a scattered field, each at the shifted frequency. Addition of feedback terms between the dipole and the particle makes only a negligible contribution to the fields. For pyridine adsorbed at the surface of a silver sphere, the 1010-cm-1 band is enhanced by $\sim$106 if the radius is much less than the wavelengths and the excitation wavelength is $\sim$382 nm, a wavelength for which the relative refractive index of silver is close to m = 2i. Detailed results are given for the effect upon the angular distribution and the polarization of the Raman emission of particle size, distance from the surface, excitation wavelength, and location of the molecule upon the surface. These results simulate those observed at roughened silver electrodes and suggest that the mechanism of SERS at those electrodes may resemble the electromagnetic mechanism elucidated here. We predict that comparable effects should be observed for fluorescent scattering.},

  abstract = {One can view our comprehension of surface-enhanced Raman scattering, particularly that by colloidal dispersions of metal sols, as the merging of two traditions in light-scattering theory and practice. One of these originated with Michael Faraday's work on brilliantly colored metal sols, which was taken up by Richard Zsigmondy and then by Gustav Mie, who accounted for the colors by electromagnetic-scattering theory. The other tradition starts with John Tyndall's work with aerosols, which stimulated Lord Rayleigh's entry into the field. Lord Rayleigh was perplexed by observations made with sulfur hydrosols, which in turn were explored by C. V. Raman. Raman's extensive work in light scattering led to his subsequent discovery of the Raman effect. These two traditions were then intertwined when it was shown that the same physical effect that caused Faraday's sols to exhibit their brilliant colors was also the origin of the enhancement of Raman signals from molecules adsorbed on the metal particles that compose these sols.},

Large cross sections were found for the cyanine reagent Cy 3 (∼140 GM) and for Rhodamine 6G (∼150 GM), both at 700 nm [1 GM = 10-50 (cm4 s)/photon]. Several fluorophores show interesting and desirable blue shifts with respect to twice the one-photon absorption wavelength. Fluorophore fluorescence intensities showed no significant departure (∓4%) from quadratic illumination power dependence, indicating genuine two-photon processes.

We calculate the photo-absorption spectra of Na2 and Na5 + comparing two different methods: quantum fluid dynamics and time-dependent density functional theory. The changes in the electronic structure associated with particular excitations are visualized in snapshots via transition densities. Our analysis shows that even for the smallest clusters, the observed excitations can be interpreted as intuitively understandable density oscillations. For Na5 +, the importance of self-interaction corrections to the adiabatic local density approximation is demonstrated.},

The mean particle size and volume fraction of silver particles, which were estimated from UV-VIS absorption spectra using Mie-Drude theory modified by electron mean free path model, rapidly increased with the reduction time of Ag+ up to $\sim$ 3 min at 900 C. The fluorescence from Eu3+ ions for the excitation by N2 laser was greatly enhanced in the presence of silver particles of 4.3 nm size. Our experimental results suggest that the origin of enhanced fluorescence is from local field enhancement around Eu3+ ions, owing to the surface plasmon resonance of small silver particles.},

The SERS enhancement appears to be directly and exclusively due to nanoparticle geometry. Effective SERS enhancements of 106 are observable in aqueous solution, which correspond to absolute enhancements of 1012 when reabsorption of Raman emission by nearby nanoparticles is taken into account.},

  abstract = {We have used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interaction of H2 molecules on the exterior surfaces of carbon nanotubes (CNTs): single and bundle types. At 80 K and 10 MPa, it is found that charge transfer occurs from a low curvature region to a high curvature region of the deformed CNT bundle, which develops charge polarization only on the deformed structure. The long-range electrostatic interactions of polarized charges on the deformed CNT bundle with hydrogen molecules are observed to induce a high local-ordering of H2 gas that results in hydrogen liquefaction. Our predicted heat of hydrogen liquefaction on the CNT bundle is 97.6 kcal kg-1. On the other hand, hydrogen liquefaction is not observed in the CNT of a single type. This is because charge polarization is not developed on the single CNT as it is symmetrically deformed under the same pressure. Consequently, the hydrogen storage capacity on the CNT bundle is much higher due to liquefaction than that on the single CNT. Additionally, our results indicate that it would also be possible to liquefy H2 gas on a more strongly polarized CNT bundle at temperatures higher than 80 K.},

  abstract = {A surface-enhanced Raman scattering SERS sensor made of Ag nanoparticles-coated Si nanowire (SiNW) arrays was fabricated for the quantitative detection of Carbaryl (an important nitrogen pesticide). H-terminated SiNWs were capable of reducing silver ions, leading to uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles on SiNW arrays. Such wire arrays exhibited a superior detection sensitivity of 10-17 M Rodamine 6G with high reproducibility. The sensor also enabled high sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability detection of Carbaryl. Significantly, the linear relation between the logarithmic concentrations and Raman peak intensities provided quantitative detection of Carbaryl.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that emission from Rhodamine-6G fluorophores adsorbed on silver nanowires experiences a spectral redshift upon propagation to the distal ends of the nanowire, with the shift being proportional to the propagation distance. The end of a nanowire thus constitutes a tunable fluorescence source controlled by a single easily adjustable parameter, i.e., the position of the excitation focal spot. The effect is made possible by a combination of radiatively undamped plasmon propagation and dispersive ohmic losses in the silver nanowire. The results may be important for the development of plasmonic waveguides, fast fluorescent color switches and various nanoscale fluorescence sensors.},

Because excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance of a nanostructured surface or nanoparticle lies at the heart of SERS, the ability to reliably control the surface characteristics has taken SERS from an interesting surface phenomenon to a rapidly developing analytical tool. This article first explains many fundamental features of SERS and then describes the use of nanosphere lithography for the fabrication of highly reproducible and robust SERS substrates. In particular, we review metal film over nanosphere surfaces as excellent candidates for several experiments that were once impossible with more primitive SERS substrates (e.g., metal island films). The article also describes progress in applying SERS to the detection of chemical warfare agents and several biological molecules.},

Its amazing ability to generate a highly visible, efficiently emitting internal fluorophore is both intrinsically fascinating and tremendously valuable. High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic function. GFP has become well established as a marker of gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organisms. Mutagenesis and engineering of GFP into chimeric proteins are opening new vistas in physiological indicators, biosensors, and photochemical memories. },

Applications of VOA to stereochemical and biological problems are reviewed, with a bias toward new kinds of experiments made possible by theoretical and instrumental advances. In the field of VCD, the most notable advances have taken place in the quality and size of ab initio calculations of VOA intensities and in the quality of step-scan Fourier transform instrumentation. For ROA, the most dramatic progress has occurred in the areas of theoretical formulation and high-throughput instrumentation. Applications of VOA now include all major classes of biological and pharmaceutical molecules. VOA's importance as a diagnostic tool will likely grow as the control of molecular chirality increases in research and industrial areas.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can be viewed as an exact reformulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics, where the fundamental variable is no longer the many-body wave function but the density. This time-dependent density is determined by solving an auxiliary set of noninteracting Schr\"odinger equations, the Kohn-Sham equations. The nontrivial part of the many-body interaction is contained in the so-called exchange-correlation potential, for which reasonably good approximations exist. Within TDDFT two regimes can be distinguished: (a) If the external time-dependent potential is ``small,'' the complete numerical solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations can be avoided by the use of linear response theory. This is the case, e.g., for the calculation of photoabsorption spectra. (b) For a ``strong'' external potential, a full solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations is in order. This situation is encountered, for instance, when matter interacts with intense laser fields. In this review we give an overview of TDDFT from its theoretical foundations to several applications both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime.},

These molecular metals exhibit highly polarizable transitions and scale in size according to the simple relation EFermi/N1/3, predicted by the free-electron model of metallic behavior. This simple scaling indicates that fluorescence arises from intraband transitions of free electrons, and these conduction-electron transitions are the low-number limit of the plasmon--the collective dipole oscillations occurring when a continuous density of states is reached. Providing the missing link between atomic and nanoparticle behavior in noble metals, these emissive, water-soluble Au nanoclusters open new opportunities for biological labels, energy-transfer pairs, and light-emitting sources in nanoscale optoelectronics. },

  abstract = {In agreement with previous results reported for colloidal silver clusters, effective surface-enhanced Raman cross sections of about 10-16 cm2 per molecule, corresponding to enhancement factors on the order of 10 14, have also been obtained for molecules attached to colloidal gold clusters. Spatially isolated nearly spherical colloidal gold particles of about 60 nm size show maximum enhancement factors on the order of 103 at 514 nm excitation, close to the single plasmon resonance. The enhancement factor increases by eleven orders of magnitude when colloidal gold clusters are formed by aggregation of the gold colloids and when near-infrared excitation is applied. The large effective surface-enhanced Raman cross section has been estimated by a straightforward method based on steady-state population redistribution due to the pumping of molecules to the first excited vibrational state via the strongly enhanced Raman process. Our experimental finding confirms the important role of colloidal clusters for extremely large surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factors. Simultaneously, it suggests colloidal gold clusters as a substrate for high-sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering, which can provide an enhancement level sufficient for Raman single molecule detection. Due to its chemical inactivity, gold might have some advantages compared to silver, particularly in biomedical spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Ultrasensitive Raman measurements in single living cells are possible through exploiting the effect of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Colloidal gold particles (60 nm in size) that are deposited inside cells as "SERS-active nanostructures" result in strongly enhanced Raman signals of the native chemical constituents of the cells. Particularly strong field enhancement can be observed when gold colloidal particles form colloidal clusters. The strongly enhanced Raman signals allow Raman measurements of a single cell in the 400-1800 cm-1 range with 1-$\mu$m lateral resolution in relatively short collection times (1 second for one mapping point) using 3-5 mW near-infrared excitation. SERS mapping over a cell monolayer with 1-$\mu$m lateral resolution shows different Raman spectra at almost all places, reflecting the very inhomogeneous chemical constitution of the cells. Colloidal gold supported Raman spectroscopy in living cells provides a tool for sensitive and structurally selective detection of native chemicals inside a cell, such as DNA and phenylalanine, and for monitoring their intracellular distributions. This might open up exciting opportunities for cell biology and biomedical studies.},

  abstract = {A new exact solution of the diffraction problem for the homogeneous spheroid on the basis of the method of separation of variables is given. This solution is considerably more efficient than the one of Asano and Yamamoto from the computational point of view. The expressions for various characteristics of the scattered radiation are obtained. The radiation pressure on spheroidal particles is considered taking into account the radial and transversal components. The method of calculations and various tests, which were used to control the computer programs, are described. Numerical results for forward and arbitrary angles scattering by prolate and oblate spheroids with the refractive indices typical for ice and silicates are presented. The dependence of the results on the propagation direction and the polarization of the incident radiation, size of particle and its aspect ratio are examined. The asymptotics for the characteristics of the scattered radiation for the extremely prolate and extremely oblate spheroids are derived. The range of the validity of these approximations is studied. Astrophysical applications include: a) the calculations of the interstellar extinction, interstellar linear and circular polarization curves for the ensemble of partially oriented spheroidal grains, and b) the consideration of the profiles and polarization of the interstellar feature ? 2200 for the partially oriented graphite spheroids. Appendices contain the expressions for integrals of products of the angular spheroidal functions and the asymptotics for the oblate spheroidal functions.},

  abstract = {We report for the first time the direct identification of the iron-carbon bond in (carbon monoxy)hemoglobins (HbCO) and -myoglobin (MbCO) by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The Fe-CO stretching, Fe-C-0 bending, and bound C-O stretching vibrations have been detected at 507 (512), 578 (577), and 1951 (1944) cm-1, respectively, in human (carbon monoxy)HbA (sperm whale MbCO) upon excitation at 406.7 nm within the Soret band. These assignments were made on the basis of frequency shifts with the isotopes 13C160, 12C180, nd 13C180. Calculated isotope shifts according to the model Im-FeC-0 (but not Im - Fe ) agree well with the observed data. The possible mechanisms of resonance Raman enhancement of these vibrations are discussed in terms of the dpi(Fe)-pi*(CO) interaction. Careful examination of the Fe-CO stretching mode at 507 cm-1 (p = 0.055) in both (carbon monoxy)HbA and (carbon monoxy)Hb Kansas with and without inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) reveals no changes in frequency and intensity. This implies that no significant change in the Fe-C bond energy is induced by switching the quaternary structure from the R to the T form in ligated (carbon monoxy)Hb Kansas. The absence of bond tension between the iron atom and the proximal histidine is suggested, as it has been demonstrated that the v(Fe-CO) frequency is sensitive to a change from 1-methylimidazole to 1,2-dimethylimidazole (as fifth ligand) in model heme-CO complexes. However, the resonance Raman spectrum of carp (carbon monoxy)Hb exhibits a broadening of the Fe-CO stretching mode on the lower energy side upon R - T conversion with IHP, suggesting the presence of a new conformer (or conformers) with a weaker Fe-CO bond or a somewhat different CO distortion.},

  abstract = {^{13}C- and ^2H-labeled retinal derivatives have been used to assign normal modes in the 1100-1300-cm^{-1} fingerprint region of the resonance Raman spectra of rhodopsin, isorhodopsin, and bathorhodopsin. On the basis of the ^{13}C shifts, C_8-C_9 stretching character is assigned at 1217 cm^{-1} in rhodopsin, at 1206 cm^{-1} in isorhodopsin, and at 1214 cm^{-1} in bathorhodopsin. C_{10}-C_{11} stretching character is localized at 1098 cm^{-1} in rhodopsin, at 1154 cm^{-1} in isorhodopsin, and at 1166 cm^{-1} in bathorhodopsin. C_{14}-C_{15} stretching character is found at 1190 cm^{-1} in rhodopsin, at 1206 cm^{-1} in isorhodopsin, and at 1210 cm^{-1} in bathorhodopsin. C_{12}-C_{13} stretching character is much more delocalized, but the characteristic coupling with the C_{14}-H rock allows us to assign the "C_{12}-C_{13} stretch" at $\sim$1240 cm^{-1} in rhodopsin, isorhodopsin, and bathorhodopsin. The insensitivity of the C_{14}-C_{15} stretching mode to N-deuteriation in all three pigments demonstrates that each contains a trans (anti) protonated Schiff base bond. The relatively high frequency of the C_{10}-C_{11} mode of bathorhodopsin demonstrates that bathorhodopsin is s-trans about the C_{10}-C_{11} single bond. This provides strong evidence against the model of bathorhodopsin proposed by Liu and Asato [Liu, R., & Asato, A. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 2591], which suggests a C_{10}-C_{11} s-cis structure. Comparison of the fingerprint modes of rhodopsin (1098, 1190, 1217, and 1239 cm^{-1}) with those of the 11-cis-retinal protonated Schiff base in methanol (1093, 1190, 1217, and 1237 cm^{-1}) shows that the frequencies of the C-C stretching modes are largely unperturbed by protein binding. In particular, the invariance of the C_{14}-C_{15} stretching mode at 1190 cm^{-1} does not support the presence of a negative protein charge near C_{13} in rhodopsin. In contrast, the frequencies of the C_5-C_9 and C_{14}-C_{15} stretches of bathorhodopsin and the C_{10}-C_{11} nd C_{14}-C_{15} stretches of isorhodopsin are significantly altered by protein binding. The implications of these observations for the mechanism of wavelength regulation in visual pigments and energy storage in bathorhodopsin are discussed.},

  abstract = {The structural and functional consequences of the introduction of a negatively charged amino acid into the active site of horse heart myoglobin have been investigated by replacement of the proximal Ser92 residue (F7) with an aspartyl residue (Ser92Asp). UV\^avisible absorption maxima of various ferrous and ferric derivatives and low-temperature EPR spectra of the metaquo (metMb) derivative indicate that the active site coordination geometry has not been perturbed significantly in the variant. 1H-NMR spectroscopy provides direct evidence for the existence of a distal water molecule as the sixth ligand in the oxidized form of the variant at pD 5.7. Spectrophotometric pH titration of the Ser92Asp variant is consistent with this finding and with a pKa = 8.90 \^A\textpm 0.02 [25.0 \^A\textdegreeC, \^I\textonequarter = 0.10 M (NaCl)] for titration of the distal water molecule, identical to the value reported for the wild-type protein. X-ray crystallography of the metMb derivative indicates that the heme substituents conserve their orientations in the variant protein, except for a slight reorientation of the pyrrole A propionate group to which Ser92 normally hydrogen bonds and reorientation of the carboxyl end of the pyrrole D propionate group. No change is observed in conformation of the proximal (His93) or distal (Wat156) heme ligands. 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the metMbCN form of the protein indicates that a slight rotation of the proximal His93 ligand has occurred in this derivative. Resonance Raman experiments indicate increased conformational heterogeneity in the proximal pocket of the variant. Failure to detect electron density for the Asp residue in the X-ray diffraction map of the variant protein and high average thermal factors for the pyrrole A propionate substituent are consistent with this observation. The variant exhibits novel pH-dependent behavior in the metMb form, as shown by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, and provides evidence for a heme-linked titratable group with a pKa of 5.4 in this derivative. The metMbCN and deoxyMb derivatives also exhibit pH-dependent behavior, with pKas of 5.60 \^A\textpm 0.07 and 6.60 \^A\textpm 0.07, respectively, compared to the wild-type values of 5.4 \^A\textpm 0.04 and 5.8 \^A\textpm 0.1. The heme-linked ionizable group is proposed to be His97 in all three derivatives. The reduction potential of the variant is 72 \^A\textpm 2 mV vs SHE [25.0 \^A\textdegreeC, \^I\textonequarter = 0.10 M (phosphate), pH 6.0], an increase of 8 mV over the wild-type value. The possible influence of a number of variables on the magnitude of the reduction potential in myoglobin and other heme proteins is discussed.},

  abstract = {Within this communication, consistent evidence of a quantitative biosensing principle for steroidal residue analysis is presented. Our approach uses a simple method for the quantitative determination of an anabolic agent called stanozolol (Sz). Sz (Mw 328) is widely used in sports, horse racing and as a growth promoter in animals for human consumption. Through the use of localised surface plasmons (LSPs), sustained by three-dimensional noble metal nano-structures, we have developed a highly specific, label-less immunosensor for the detection of this small organic molecule to low levels (nM range). A main practical advantage over conventional flat extended film surface plasmon resonance (SPR) systems is the simplicity of the optical configuration, since there is no need for cumbersome total internal reflection illumination, thus making integration easier. In addition, the active area of the LSP-based sensor is smaller, decreasing the minimum detectable number of molecules involved in the binding event. Assay times are short and the set-up is comprised of relatively cheap instrumentation. Detection levels found here are comparable with SPR, even at this early stage of development and with further modifications, we envisage sensing down to pM (10-12) levels.},

The intrinsic fluorescence from DNA is very weak and almost all methods for detecting DNA rely on the use of extrinsic fluorescent probes. We show that the intrinsic emission from DNA can be enhanced many-fold by spatial proximity to silver island films. Silver islands are subwavelength size patches of metallic silver on an inert substrate. Time-resolved measurements show a decreased lifetime for the intrinsic DNA emission near the silver islands. These results of increased intensity and decreased lifetime indicate a metal-induced increase in the radiative rate decay of the DNA bases.

  abstract = {In order to study the vicinal effect of the L-amino acid coordinated in a complex on the central metal ion, a number of cobalt(III) L-amino acid complexes of three types were prepared, i. e., [Co(NH3)5(L-amH)]X3, [Co(L-am)(NH3)4]SO4, and trans-[Co en2(L-amH)2]X3, where L-amH denotes an L-amino acid, and where X is Cl, Br, or I. The circular dichroism (CD) and the rotatory dispersion (RD) spectra of their aqueous solutions were measured in the wavelength range from 650 to 300 m$\mu$. In the region of the first absorption band, both the [Co(NH3)5(L-amH)]3+ and the trans-[Co en2(L-amH)2]3+ ions show one or two CD bands to be expected in complexes of the C4v symmetry with a structure of the [Co N5O]-type and of the D4h symmetry with a structure of the trans-[Co N4O2]-type respectively. The positions of the CD bands observed in the trans complexes coincide well with the maxima of the split components, Ia and Ib, of the first absorption band. The CD spectra of different [Co(L-am)(NH3)4]2+ ions, in which L-am is a bidentate ligand, show a variety of behavior; they are discussed from a stereochemical point of view. An intense CD band of the [Co(L-prol)(NH3)4]2+ ion at about 510 m$\mu$ can be attributed to the vicinal effect of an asymmetric nitrogen atom of the coordinated L-prolinate ion. For the trans-[Co en2(L-amH)2]X3 complexes, the rotatory parameters and rotatory strengths were calculated by means of analyses of the experimental CD and RD curves.},

  abstract = {NMR and CD spectral features of a series of thiaheterohelicenes containing alternant thiophene and benzene rings were examined as associated with their helical structures. The terminal ring protons of the thiaheterohelicenes reflected the characteristics of intramolecular overlap of aromatic rings in 1H NMR spectra. With the progression of the helix a sudden chemical shift of the $\beta$ proton in the end thiophene ring to the higher field occurred, in contrast to carbohelicenes in which the drift of the upfield shift of the corresponding terminal ring proton was gradually suppressed. The CD spectra of thiaheterohelicenes were quite different from those of carbohelicenes. The intensities of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ absorption bands weakened with the progressive annelation, whereas the intensity of the p absorption band gradually increased, accompanied by a successive increase in the anisotropy factor of the band. These facts suggest that the structures of thiaheterohelicenes differ from those of carbohelicenes in having a peculiar distortion of the helix.},

This work presents the first experimental evidence that the ldquothickrdquo gold film (TGF) may be specifically annealed to serve as a substrate for surface-enhanced fluorescence or surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy of the same molecule. High-resolved SERS spectra of mitoxantrone (mitox) were recorded on the TGF annealed at 340C whereas no Raman enhancement but an increase of mitox fluorescence signal were detected on the TGF annealed at 240 C. The mitox fluorescence was further enhanced by deposition of monolayers of pentanethiol or poly-L-lysine on the surface of annealed TGF. The maximal fluorescence enhancement factor per mitox molecule of approximately 50 that was obtained on the annealed TGF covered with poly-L-lysine makes the system promising for applications in immunofluorescence assays and in microspectrofluorescence analysis.},

  abstract = {A method for engineering and producing genetically modified cats is important for generating biomedical models of human diseases. Here we describe the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce cloned transgenic cats that systemically express red fluorescent protein. Immature oocytes were collected from superovulating cat ovaries. Donor fibroblasts were obtained from an ear skin biopsy of a white male Turkish Angora cat, cultured for one to two passages, and subjected to transduction with a retrovirus vector designed to transfer and express the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene. A total of 176 RFP cloned embryos were transferred into 11 surrogate mothers (mean = 16 \textpm 7.5 per recipient). Three surrogate mothers were successfully impregnated (27.3%) and delivered two liveborn and one stillborn kitten at 65 to 66 days of gestation. Analysis of nine feline-specific microsatellite loci confirmed that the cloned cats were genetically identical to the donor cat. Presence of the RFP gene in the transgenic cat genome was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Whole-body red fluorescence was detected 60 days after birth in the liveborn transgenic (TG) cat but not in the surrogate mother cat. Red fluorescence was detected in tissue samples, including hair, muscle, brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, bronchus, lung, stomach, intestine, tongue, and even excrement of the stillborn TG cat. These results suggest that this nuclear transfer procedure using genetically modified somatic cells could be useful for the efficient production of transgenic cats.},

The FeP(Im)(CO) model is characterized by an essentially upright FeCO unit, undergoing small deviations with respect to its linear equilibrium structure (bending and tilting up to 10\textdegree and 7\textdegree, often occur). The motion of the carbon monoxide ligand is found to be quite complex and fast, its projection on the porphyrin plane sampling all the porphyrin quadrants in a short time ($\sim$0.5 ps). Simultaneously, the imidazole ligand rotates slowly around the Fe-N[epsilon] bond. In contrast to carbon monoxide, the oxygen ligand in FeP(Im)(O2) prefers a conformation where the projection of the O-O axis on the porphyrin plane bisects one of the porphyrin quadrants. A transition to other quadrants takes place through an O-O/Fe-Np overlapping conformation, within 4-6 ps. Further details of these mechanisms and their implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {The influence of the distal pocket conformation on the structure and vibrations of the heme-CO bond in carbonmonoxy myoglobin (MbCO) is investigated by means of hybrid QM/MM calculations based on density functional theory combined with a classical force field. It is shown that the heme-CO structure (QM treated) is quite rigid and not influenced by the distal pocket conformation (MM treated). This excludes any relation between FeCO distortions and the different CO absorptions observed in the infrared spectra of MbCO (A states). In contrast, both the CO stretch frequency and the strength of the CO\textperiodcentered\textperiodcentered\textperiodcenteredHis64 interaction are very dependent on the orientation and tautomerization state of His64. Our calculations indicate that the CO\textperiodcentered\textperiodcentered\textperiodcenteredN[epsilon] type of approach does not contribute to the A states, whereas the CO\textperiodcentered\textperiodcentered\textperiodcenteredH-N[epsilon] interaction is the origin of the A1 and A3 states, the His64 residue being protonated at N[epsilon]. The strength of the CO\textperiodcentered\textperiodcentered\textperiodcenteredHis64 interaction is quantified, in comparison with the analogous O2\textperiodcentered\textperiodcentered\textperiodcenteredHis64 interaction and with the observed changes in the CO stretch frequency. Additional aspects of the CO\textperiodcentered\textperiodcentered\textperiodcenteredHis64 interaction and its biological implications are discussed.},

Our average BDE of 8.1 kcal/mol agrees well with experiment and shows that Mb weakens the Fe-CO bond by 5.8 kcal/mol; the calculations provide detailed atomistic insight into the origin of this effect. BDEs for Mb conformations with the R carbonmonoxy tertiary structure are on average 2.6 kcal/mol larger than those with the T deoxy tertiary structure, suggesting two functionally distinct allosteric states. This allostery is partly explained by the reduction in distal cavity steric crowding as Mb moves from its T to R tertiary structure.},

MR based configuration interaction (MRCI) methods are also briefly touched and the spectroscopy oriented CI (SORCI) variant developed in this laboratory is described in some detail. The operators to describe the leading relativistic effects (scalar relativity and spin-orbit coupling (SOC)) are described afterwards. The CASSCF and SORCI methods are first applied to the calculation of the multiplets of the free dipositive and tripositive first-row transition metal ions followed by a discussion of calculations of molecular d-d multiplet states in dipositive and tripositive hexaquo complexes of the first transition row. We then turn to the subject of the treatment of SOC in CASSCF and MRCI based approaches in some detail. The final part of the review provides an introduction into the theory of the resonance Raman effect, the possible quantum chemical calculation of resonance Raman intensities, the implementation of the method into the ORCA electronic structure program system followed by an application to the resonance Raman and absorption spectra of transition metal dithiolene complexes.},

We have examined in detail the [Phi] value of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2'-bipyridine) complex which have been often used as the standards in the determination of quantum yields of transition-metal complexes. This revealed that the [Phi] values for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ were 0.063 in deaerated H2O, 0.040 in aerated H2O, 0.095 in deaerated CH3CN, and 0.018 in aerated CH3CN, respectively, which are significantly higher than the previously accepted values. We have also examined the technical aspects in the determination of absolute emission quantum yields for lanthanide complexes and those of organic crystals of anthracene. For the accurate determination for lanthanide complexes, special care must be taken in the spectroscopic measurements because of their narrow absorption and emission bands. For organic crystals, the fluorescence quantum yields are reduced due to reabsorption, chemical impurities and structural defects. Our observations for highly purified anthracene crystals revealed that the lower limit value of [Phi] was 0.64.},

  abstract = {The view that the hydrogen bonds in Watson-Crick adenine-thymine (AT) and guanine-cytosine (GC) base pairs are in essence electrostatic interactions with substantial resonance assistance from the pi electrons is questioned. Our investigation is based on a state-of-the-art density functional theoretical (DFT) approach (BP86/TZ2P) that has been shown to properly reproduce experimental data. Through a quantitative decomposition of the hydrogen bond energy into its various physical terms, we demonstrate that, contrary to the widespread belief, donor-acceptor orbital interactions (i.e., charge transfer) in a symmetry between N or O lone pairs on one base and N-H sigma{*}-acceptor orbitals on the other base do provide a substantial bonding contribution which is, in fact, of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic interaction term. The overall orbital interactions are reinforced by a small pi component which stems from polarization in the pi-electron system of the individual bases. This pi component is, however, one order of magnitude smaller than the sigma term. Furthermore, we have investigated the synergism in a base pair between charge transfer from one base to the other through one hydrogen bond and in the opposite direction through another hydrogen bond, as well as the cooperative effect between the donor-acceptor interactions in the sigma- and polarization in the pi-electron system. The possibility of C-H ... O hydrogen bonding in AT is also examined. In the course of these analyses, we introduce an extension of the Voronoi deformation density (VDD) method which monitors the redistribution of the sigma- and pi-electron densities individually out of (Delta Q > 0) or into (Delta Q < 0) the Voronoi cell of an atom upon formation of the base pair from the separate bases.},

  abstract = {The chemical bonds in the diatomic molecules Li-2-F-2 and Na-2-Cl-2 at different bond lengths have been analyzed by the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) method using DFT calculations at the BP86/TZ2P level. The interatomic interactions are discussed in terms of quasiclassical electrostatic interactions Delta E-elstat, Pauli repulsion Delta E-Pauli and attractive orbital interactions Delta E-Pauli. The energy terms are compared with the orbital overlaps at different interatomic distances. The quasiclassical electrostatic interactions between two electrons occupying 1s, 2s, 2p(sigma), and 2p(pi) orbitals have been calculated and the results are analyzed and discussed. It is shown that the equilibrium distances of the covalent bonds are not determined by the maximum overlap of the sigma valence orbitals, which nearly always has its largest value at clearly shorter distances than the equilibrium bond length. The crucial interaction that prevents shorter bonds is not the loss of attractive interactions, but a sharp increase in the Pauli repulsion between electrons in valence orbitals. The attractive interactions of Delta E-orb and the repulsive interactions of Delta E-orb are both determined by the orbital overlap. The net effect of the two terms depends on the occupation of the valence orbitals, but the onset of attractive orbital interactions occurs at longer distances than Pauli repulsion, because overlap of occupied orbitals with vacant orbitals starts earlier than overlap between occupied orbitals. The contribution of Delta E-elslat in most nonpolar covalent bonds is strongly attractive. This comes from the deviation of quasiclassical electron-electron repulsion and nuclear-electron attraction from Coulomb's law for point charges. The actual strength of Delta E-elstat depends on the size and shape of the occupied valence orbitals. The attractive electrostatic contributions in the diatomic molecules Li-2-F-2 come from the s and p(sigma) electrons, while the p(pi) electrons do not compensate for nuclear-nuclear repulsion. It is the interplay of the three terms Delta E-orb, Delta E-Pauli, and Delta E-elstat that determines the bond energies and equilibrium distances of covalently bonded molecules. Molecules like N-2 and O-2, which are usually considered as covalently bonded, would not be bonded without the quasiclassical attraction Delta E-elstat.},

  abstract = {Geometry is one of the primary and most direct indicators of aromaticity and antiaromaticity: a regular structure with delocalized double bonds (e.g., benzene) is symptomatic of aromaticity, whereas a distorted geometry with localized double bonds (e.g., 1,3-cyclobutadiene) is characteristic of antiaromaticity. Here, we present a molecular-orbital (MO) model of aromaticity that explains, in terms of simple orbital-overlap arguments, why this is so. Our MO model is based on accurate Kohn-Sham DFT analyses of the bonding in benzene, 1,3-cyclobutadiene, cyclohexane, and cyclobutane, and how the bonding mechanism is affected if these molecules undergo geometrical deformations between regular, delocalized ring structures, and distorted ones with localized double bonds. We show that the propensity of the pi electrons is always, that is, in both the aromatic and antiaromatic molecules, to localize the double bonds, against the delocalizing force of the sigma electrons. More importantly, we show that the pi electrons nevertheless decide about the localization or delocalization of the double bonds. A key component of our model for uncovering and resolving this seemingly contradictory situation is to analyze the bonding in the various model systems in terms of two interpenetrating fragments that preserve, in good approximation, their geometry along the localization/delocalization modes.},

The interaction of crystal violet with a single water molecule shifts and broadens the photodissociation spectrum, so that it approaches the spectrum obtained in solution.

This new aptameric sensor is based on the conformational change of the surface-tethered aptamer on a binding target that draws a certain Raman reporter in close proximity to the SERS substrate, thereby increasing the Raman scattering signal due to the local enhancement effect of SERS. To improve the response performance, the sensor is fabricated from a cocaine-templated mixed self-assembly of a 3-terminal tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled DNA aptamer on a silver colloid film by means of an alkanethiol moiety at the 5 end. This immobilization strategy optimizes the orientation of the aptamer on the surface and facilitates the folding on the binding target. Under optimized assay conditions, one can determine cocaine at a concentration of 1M, which compares favorably with analogous aptameric sensors based on electrochemical and fluorescence techniques. The sensor can be readily regenerated by being washed with a buffer. These results suggest that the SERS-based transducer might create a new dimension for future development of aptameric sensors for sensitive determination in biochemical and biomedical studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes are widely used as light harvesters in dye-sensitized solar cells. Since one of the potential applications of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their derived materials is their use as active components in organic and hybrid solar cells, the study of the photochemistry of SWCNTs with tethered ruthenium polypyridyl complexes is important. A water-soluble ruthenium tris(bipyridyl) complex linked through peptidic bonds to SWCNTs (Ru-SWCNTs) was prepared by radical addition of thiol-terminated SWCNT to a terminal C-C double bond of a bipyridyl ligand of the ruthenium tris(bipyridyl) complex. The resulting macromolecular Ru-SWCNT (500 nm, 15.6% ruthenium complex content) was water-soluble and was characterized by using TEM, thermogravimetric analysis, chemical analysis, and optical spectroscopy. The emission of Ru-SWCNT is 1.6 times weaker than that of a mixture of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and SWCNT of similar concentration. Time-resolved absorption optical spectroscopy allows the detection of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+-excited triplet and [Ru(bpy)3]+. The laser flash studies reveal that Ru-SWCNT exhibits an unprecedented two-photon process that is enabled by the semiconducting properties of the SWCNT. Thus, the effect of the excitation wavelength and laser power on the transient spectra indicate that upon excitation of two [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes of Ru-SWCNT, a disproportionation process occurs leading to delayed formation of [Ru(bpy)3]+ and the performance of the SWCNT as a semiconductor. This two-photon delayed [Ru(bpy)3]+ generation is not observed in the photolysis of [Ru(bpy)3]3+; SWCNT acts as an electron wire or electron relay in the disproportionation of two [Ru(bpy)3]2+ triplets in a process that illustrates that the SWCNT plays a key role in the process. We propose a mechanism for this two-photon disproportionation compatible with i) the need for high laser flux, ii) the long lifetime of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ triplets, iii) the semiconducting properties of the SWNT, and iv) the energy of the HOMO/LUMO levels involved.},

We review and present experiments using various physical methods at electrodes and at ultra high vacuum samples to prove the existence of SAS, which are probably situated within fractal monoatomic steps. As the first adsorbates in ultrahigh vacuum migrate to the SAS, scanning tunnelling microscopy can reveal their atomic structure. CO on vicinal Au(211) first settles down at the kink sites. NO dissociates and CO2 is activated on a subgroup of SAS of cold-deposited Cu, these processes are only observed by SERS but not by infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS).

The second scheme, similar to that suggested by Stone, retains the fully distributed description of the dynamic charge-flow polarizabilities, while all two-center dipole-dipole and charge-dipole contributions are condensed in one-center dynamic dipole-dipole polarizabilities.},

  abstract = {We report the synthesis and chiroptical properties of silver nanocluster enantiomers. The surface of the silver nanoclusters is covered with l/d-penicillamine or their racemate. The clusters are separated by gel electrophoresis according to their charge and size into well-defined compounds. The mean core diameter of each fractioned component varies from 1 to 3 nm. The separated compounds of silver nanoclusters covered with l- or d-form thiol show strong optical activity or circular dichroism with opposite sign (mirror image relationship) in the metal-based electronic transitions (obtained anisotropy factor is on the order of 1 \AA 10-3 to 1 \AA 10-5), suggesting that the nanoclusters have well-defined stereostructures as common chiral molecules do. With a decrease in the mean cluster diameter, the anisotropy factor gradually increases at first, but a steep rise is observed when the diameter becomes smaller than \^a\textonequarter1.5 nm. The chiroptical response of the silver nanoclusters is consequently several-fold larger than that of the gold nanoclusters having the same ligand. The possibilities of a dissymmetric field model as well as an inherently chiral core model are discussed as the origin of the intense optical activity.},

  abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate 3D two-photon recording and two-photon readout in photochromic polymer composites containing a mixture of 1,2-bis(2-methylbenzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)hexafluorocyclopentene (diarylethene 1) and fluorene derivatives 2,2'-(9,9-didecyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene)) dibenzo[d]thiazole (2) or poly(9,9-didecyl-2,7-dipheylaminofluorene) (3). The recording mechanism in this system is based on two-photon excitation of the closed form of diarylethene 1 at 800 nm. The readout mechanism is based on the modulation of the emission intensity of fluorene derivatives 2 or 3 by the closed form of diarylethene 1 through Resonance Energy Transfer (RET). F\"orster distances (R0) and critical concentrations (A0) were calculated from the spectral overlap of the donor's emission (fluorene derivatives) and the acceptor's absorption (closed form of diarylethene 1) in solution and in polymer films of PMMA-co-VBP. This system was demonstrated to be suitable for recording data by two-photon excitation in thick storage media. The RET-based readout method proved to be essentially nondestructive (exhibiting a loss of the initial fluorescence emission less than 20% of the initial emission after 10000 readout cycles), providing a solution to a long-standing challenge in photochromic optical data storage.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the design, synthesis, two-photon absorption (TPA) properties, and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) features of a new class of cruciforms. These new cruciforms utilize the anthracene ring as a $\pi$-center and exhibit very large and significantly enhanced two-photon absorption cross sections ($\delta$) that are two to four times as large as the sum of the $\delta$ values of the two corresponding linear analogues over a relatively wide range of wavelengths (740-900 nm). Quantum chemical calculations and solvatochromic behaviors reveal that donor-acceptor-substituted anthracene-centered cruciforms show spatially separated HOMO and LUMO. Although the enhancement of $\delta$ in anthracene-centered cruciforms seems to be not relative to their FMO features, this is thoroughly different from the known characteristics of benzene-centered analogues showing no enhancement of $\delta$. On considering that the only difference in these cruciforms is the $\pi$-center, it is primarily concluded that the anthracene core plays a crucial role in the enhancement of $\delta$.},

To map these O(N) algorithms onto parallel computers with deep memory hierarchies, we have developed a tunable hierarchical cellular-decomposition (THCD) framework, which achieves performance tunability through a hierarchy of parameterized cell data/computation structures and adaptive load balancing through wavelet-based computational-space decomposition. Benchmark tests on 1920 Itanium2 processors of the NASA Columbia supercomputer have achieved unprecedented scales of quantum-mechanically accurate and well validated, chemically reactive atomistic simulations--0.56 billion-atom F-ReaxFF MD and 1.4 million-atom (0.12 trillion grid points) EDC-DFT MD--in addition to 18.9 billion-atom non reactive space-time multiresolution MD. The EDC and THCD frameworks expose maximal data localities, and consequently the isogranular parallel efficiency on 1920 processors is as high as 0.953. Chemically reactive MD simulations have been applied to shock-initiated detonation of energetic materials and stress-induced bond breaking in ceramics in corrosive environments.},

Interlayer distances of these novel DWCNTs are different with those of normal DWCNTs, i.e. 0.34 nm. Their initial equilibrium configurations and buckling behaviors under axial compression are simulated to examine the influence of the van der Waals force on the mechanical properties of DWCNTs. The interaction of atoms in each tube is described by the Tersoff-Brenner potential, while the van der Waals force between inner and outer walls is described by the Lennard-Jones potential. Numerical results show that the different van der Waals force coming from different interlayer spacing results in different critical buckling strain of DWCNTs under axial compression. These new DWCNTs exhibit better compressive stability as compared with the normal DWCNT.},

Although fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, where single molecules can readily be detected, there is still a drive for reduced detection limits. The detection of a fluorophore is usually limited by its quantum yield, autofluorescence of the samples and/or the photostability of the fluorophores; however, there has been a recent explosion in the use of metallic nanostructures to favorably modify the spectral properties of fluorophores and to alleviate some of these fluorophore photophysical constraints. The use of fluorophore-metal interactions has been termed radiative decay engineering, metal-enhanced fluorescence or surface-enhanced fluorescence.},

In finite precision arithmetic, these computed residuals may be inaccurate, that is, they may differ significantly from the (true) residuals that correspond to the computed approximations. In this paper we will propose variants on Neumaier's strategy, originally proposed for CGS, and explain its success. In particular, we will propose a more restrictive strategy for accumulating groups of updates for updating the residual and the approximation, and we will show that this may improve the accuracy significantly, while maintaining speed of convergence. This approach avoids restarts and allows for more reliable stopping criteria. We will discuss updating conditions and strategies that are efficient, lead to accurate residuals, and are easy to implement. For CGS and Bi-CG these strategies are particularly attractive, but they may also be used to improve Bi-CGSTAB, BiCGstab(l), as well as other methods.},

Experiments were performed using near-infrared excitation on crystal violet adsorbed on colloidal silver or gold clusters. Strong enhancement factors on the order of 10^20 were inferred from hyper-Raman scattering experiments on colloidal silver. Such extremely high enhancement factors overcome the inherently weak nature of the effect, and surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering appears on comparable intensity levels as surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Surface-enhanced anti-Stokes Raman scattering starts from vibrational levels, that are populated by the very strong surface-enhanced Raman process. Thus, the anti-Stokes Raman scattering signal depends quadratically on the excitation laser intensity. For the first time, surface-enhanced anti-Stokes and Stokes Raman scattering was detected from single molecules on colloidal gold clusters.},

  abstract = {Surface enhanced resonance Raman spectra of Fe-protoporphyrin IX, adsorbed on silver colloidal nanoparticles immobilized onto a polymer-coated glass slide have been investigated at very low concentrations. The spectra exhibit drastic temporal fluctuations on a time scale of seconds in both line frequency and intensity; such a trend suggesting that the single molecule limit is approached. Sequences of spectra have been analyzed in terms of an underlying continuum and of Raman peaks superimposed on this continuum. A statistical analysis of the spectrum intensity has allowed us to put into evidence that main contribution to the intensity fluctuations arises from the continuum. In addition, a high correlation between the total integrated intensity and the intensity detected at different Raman peaks has been revealed. Furthermore, the ratio between the intensity detected in correspondence of different FePP vibrational modes shows a temporal variability likely reflecting the intrinsic dynamics of the molecule. All these findings have been ascribed to a desorption-adsorption mechanism of the molecules at the silver surface.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectra of individual crystal violet molecules adsorbed on silver colloids were measured and analyzed. It was found that, because of the small number of hot spots on the surface of the colloids, the single-molecule limit is attained already at a molecule to colloid ratio of 103. Series of time-dependent spectra measured from individual molecules showed significant spectral jumps, involving essentially only the low-frequency part of the spectrum. Each spectrum could therefore be analyzed as belonging to one of two groups, depending on the ratio between its two parts. Spectral trajectories were converted into simplified two-state (high/low) trajectories. Probability distributions of the dwell times in the two states were constructed from the trajectories, and statistical analysis showed that the dynamic process underlying the spectral jumps is likely to be Markovian. We suggest that the jumps originate in fluctuations of molecule-surface charge transfer interactions, although our studies did not provide evidence for lateral motion of the molecules, as found previously with rhodamine 6G.},

  abstract = {Doubly excited states play important roles in the low-energy region of the optical spectra of polyenes and their investigation has been subject of theoretical and experimental studies for more than 30 years now and still is in the focus of ongoing research. In this work, we address the question why doubly excited states play a role in the low-energy region of the optical spectrum of molecular systems at all, since from a naive point of view one would expect their excitation energy approximately twice as large as the one of the corresponding single excitation. Furthermore, we show that extended-ADC(2) is well suited for the balanced calculation of the low-lying excited View the MathML source, View the MathML source and View the MathML source states of long all-trans polyenes, which are known to possess substantial double excitation character. A careful re-investigation of the performance of TDDFT calculations for these states reveals that the previously reported good performance for the View the MathML source state relies heavily on fortuitous cancellation of errors. Finally, the title question is answered such that for short polyenes the lowest excited View the MathML source and View the MathML source states can clearly be classified as doubly excited, whereas the View the MathML source ground state is essentially represented by the (ground-state) HF determinant. For longer polyenes, in addition to increasing double excitation contributions in the View the MathML source and View the MathML source states, the ground state itself aquires substantial double excitation character (45% in C22H24), so that the transition from the ground state to these excited states should not be addressed as the excitation of two electrons relative to the View the MathML source ground state.},

For the non-radiative transition process, the conventional assumption of (single) "promoting-mode" is abandoned and a promoting-mode free formula is presented. Using this new rate formalism, we re-examine the well-established photophysical properties of anthracene. Both the calculated radiative and non-radiative rates are in good agreement with the available experimental measurements and previous theoretical values. Furthermore, we rationalize the exotic aggregation induced emission phenomenon in 9-[(o-Aminophenyl)phenylmethylene]-9H-fluorene molecule: the roles of low-frequency phenyl ring twist motions and their Duschinsky mode mixings are found to be crucial, especially for the temperature dependence. The present rate theory can quantitatively describe the excited-states dynamic processes in large molecules and is a powerful tool for the design of new high-efficiency light-emitting materials.},

  abstract = {We present a hybrid Car-Parrinello quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach that is capable of treating the dynamics of molecular systems in electronically excited states in complex environments. The potential energy surface in the excited state is described either within the restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) formalism or within time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). As a test case, we apply this technique to the study of the solvent effects on the ground state and on the first excited singlet state of acetone in water. Our results demonstrate that for this system a purely classical description of the solvent is sufficient, since inclusion of the first solvent shell of 12 water molecules into the quantum system does not show a significant effect on this transition. The excited-state energies calculated with ROKS are red shifted by a constant value compared to the TDDFT results, while the relative variations of the excitation energy for different configurations are in very good agreement. The experimentally observed blue shift of the excitation energy in going from gas phase to condensed phase is well reproduced. Excited-state dynamics carried out with ROKS yield the relaxation of the solute and the rearrangement of the solvent structure on a picosecond timescale. The calculated Stokes shift is in reasonable agreement with experimental data.},

Our purpose is to arrive at a qualitative understanding, based on accurate calculations, of the trends in activation barriers and transition state (TS) geometries (e.g. early or late along the reaction coordinate) in terms of the reactantsrsquo properties. To this end, we extend the activation strain model (in which the activation energy DeltaEne is decomposed into the activation strain DeltaEnestrain of the reactants and the stabilizing TS interaction DeltaEneint between the reactants) from a single-point analysis of the TS to an analysis along the reaction coordinate zeta, that is, DeltaE(zeta)=DeltaEstrain(zeta)+DeltaEint(zeta). This extension enables us to understand qualitatively, trends in the position of the TS along zeta and, therefore, the values of the activation strain DeltaEnestrain=DeltaEstrain(zetaTS) and TS interaction DeltaEneint=DeltaEint(zetaTS) and trends therein. An interesting insight that emerges is that the much higher barrier of metal-mediated C\&bond;C versus C\&bond;H activation originates from steric shielding of the C\&bond;C bond in ethane by C\&bond;H bonds. Thus, before a favorable stabilizing interaction with the C\&bond;C bond can occur, the C\&bond;H bonds must be bent away, which causes the metal-substrate interaction DeltaEint(zeta) in C\&bond;C activation to lag behind. Such steric shielding is not present in the metal-mediated activation of the C\&bond;H bond, which is always accessible from the hydrogen side. Other phenomena that are addressed are anion assistance, competition between direct oxidative insertion (OxIn) versus the alternative SN2 pathway, and the effect of ring strain.},

In MD simulations, these methods provide efficient and accurate algorithms for computing the energy and forces of charge-charge interactions. However, dipolar interactions are as important and as challenging to compute. In this paper we implement the cell multipole method (CMM) for dipolar domains. This CMM implementation is an accurate and efficient approach for computing interactions in million-particle dipolar systems. In addition, we use CMM to treat systems of permanent dipoles and induced dipoles, permanent charges and permanent dipoles, and permanent charges and induced dipoles. We derive and discuss expressions for accurate and efficient computation of all interactions in these systems. The approach is also applicable to polarizable charged dipolar systems. Finally, we apply one-level CMM and hierarchical CMM to arbitrary dipolar systems and discuss accuracy and speed. The hierarchical implementation of CMM is shown to scale linearly with the number of dipoles.},

We will focus on certain aspects of the implementation which are necessary for an efficient evaluation of the desired properties, enabling the treatment of large molecules. Such an efficient implementation is obtained by: using the full symmetry of the molecule, using a set of auxiliary functions for fitting the (zeroth- and first-order) electron density, using a highly vectorized and parallelized code, using linear scaling techniques, and, most importantly, by solving the response equations iteratively.},

@ARTICLE{cpch_9_1617,
  abstract = {We explore the application of a previously suggested formula for determining the degree of charge transfer in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). SERS is often described as a phenomenon which obtains its enhancement from three major sources, namely the surface plasmon resonance, charge-transfer resonances as well as possible molecular resonances. At any chosen excitation wavelength, it is possible to obtain contributions from several sources and this has led to considerable confusion. The formula for the degree of charge transfer enables one to separate these effects, but it requires that spectra be obtained either at two or more different excitation wavelengths or as a function of applied potential. We apply this formula to several examples, which display rather large charge-transfer contributions to the spectrum. These are p-aminothiophenol (PATP), tetracyano- ethylene (TCNE) and piperidine. In PATP we can show that several lines of the same symmetry give the same degree of charge transfer. In TCNE we are able to identify the charge-transfer transition, which contributes to the effect, and are able to independently determine the degree of charge transfer by wavenumber shifts. This enables a comparison of the two techniques of measurement. In piperidine, we present an example of molecule to metal charge transfer and show that our definition of charge transfer is independent of direction.},

The assignment of these spectra as valid examples of SERS and SERRS in a non-aqueous environment is based on the following criteria: (1) in situ demonstration of monolayer surface coverage of Ru(bpy)32+ using double potential step chronocoulometry (DPSCC); (2) the Raman signals are most intense after surface roughening by anodization; (3) the Raman spectra are potential dependent in the non-faradaic potential region; (4) the measured enhancement factors are greater than 10^6; (5) the surface spectra are frequency shifted relative to their bulk counterpart; and (6) several other molecules also exhibit non-aqueous SERS and SERRS behavior. These results are highly significant in that generality of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy has been extended into the rich domain of nonaqueous electrochemistry.},

The assignment of the lowest excited states - observed in absorption - agrees with an earlier classification of the emitting states. In particular, the E [perpendicular] c-polarized transition A'1 [right harpoon over left] 2E' (classified in D'3), at 17816 cm-1, is found at the same energy (experimental error: \textpm 1 cm-1) in emission and absorption and represents a zero-phonon, zero-vibron transition.

This wavelength is coincident with the lowest-lying Rydberg excitation. The scattering activity of the [nu]2 coordinate is dramatically reduced in the solution spectra as compared to the gas phase results. This quenching of [nu]2 Raman activity is largely attributed to significant increases in the pure dephasing rate of the Rydberg transition in solution and multimode effects due to the coupling of the resonant excitation to low-frequency solvent-dependent bath modes. The inversion barrier in the ground electronic state is estimated to increase by at least 475 cm-1 in n-hexane solution.},

These models ([Delta]Exc,[lambda]model) make use of the exact Ex and generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) to Exc. The construction of the simplest model is verified by calculating the exact d[Delta]Exc,[lambda]/d[lambda][lambda]=0 from density functional pertubation theory and comparing it to d[Delta]Exc, [lambda]model/d[lambda][lambda]=0. For systems with strong static correlations, explicit inclusion of d[Delta]Exc,[lambda]/d[lambda][lambda]=0 further improves the approximation to [Delta]Exc, [lambda]. Atomization energies calculated from [Delta]Exc,[lambda]model show a significant improvement over GGA.},

Appropriate sequences of hopping times are considered and the output wavepackets associated with each sequence are summed coherently.

Resonance Raman (RR) spectra have been recorded for 4-nitro,4′-dimethylamino-azobenzene (DA) within the charge-transfer transition, in acetonitrile and benzonitrile. Mode-specific and solvent reorganization energies are determined by simulating the absorption and RR spectra. The results indicate that the vibrational reorganization energy for DA is comparable in the two solvents and the difference is observed mainly in the solvent reorganization energy that has been partitioned into inertial and reorientational components. The inertial response has greater contribution than its reorientational counterpart in acetonitrile, as expected, whereas the reverse trend is observed in benzonitrile.},

The frequency dependent polarizability is calculated and shown to display strong confinement effects and features similar to what is predicted by semi-classical electrodynamic theory.},

  abstract = {Excited states of furan and pyrrole were studied by time-dependent density functional theory. The effect of basis set and density functional on the vertical excitation energies was investigated. Energy gradients and dipole moments were evaluated analytically. Stationary points on the lowest excited states were determined. Harmonic frequencies and (v′=0\textleftarrowv=0) excitation energies were evaluated. Many of the results agree well with the experimental values available as well as most recent theoretical ab initio values, but there remain discrepancies in the valence states. The dipole moments of many excited states show a large variation with the basis set and functional; this is due to the fact that the states have an extremely large polarisability.},

Although the measured TPA spectra showed that the observed nonlinear refractive index change was regarded to be off-resonant; difference in the frequency dispersion among the molecules considerably contributes to the decrease, in addition to difference in the intrinsic static nonlinearity.

We show that a single point charge is sufficient to change the photoproduct distribution such that isomerization is restricted to only one of the two bonds where isomerization is observed in the isolated chromophore. These results corroborate recent speculations concerning the role of Arg52 in the photocycle of PYP.},

  abstract = {We review our recent studies of electromagnetic coupling and associated temporal dynamics of molecular excitations with plasmonic resonances supported by either localized or extended planar geometries. We focus on coherent interactions between plasmon resonances and molecular excitations, which are experimentally challenging due to the very short (10-100 fs) coherence times of plasmons. Recent experimental results and theoretical analysis for observing and controlling coherences between molecular excitations and plasmonic polarizations are shown. Advances will explore new directions in ultrafast coherent control of molecular excited states and energy dissipation processes, as well as ultrafast addressing and switching in plasmonics-based circuit architectures.},

  abstract = {Andreas Dreuw was born in 1972 in Neuss, Germany. He received his undergraduate education in chemistry at the universities of D\"usseldorf and Heidelberg. In 1997, he joined the theoretical chemistry group of Prof. Lorenz Cederbaum in Heidelberg and received his Ph.D. in 2001. Then he moved to the University of California at Berkeley to join the research group of Prof. Martin Head-Gordon as an ``Emmy Noether'' postdoctoral fellow of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Since 2003, he has been at the University of Frankfurt where he is leading an independent research group funded within the ``Emmy Noether'' program. His research interests comprise the development of theoretical methods for the calculation of excited states of large molecules as well as their application to biological problems such as electron and energy transfer processes in phostosynthesis. Martin Head-Gordon was born in Canberra, Australia (1962), and grew up in Halifax, Canada, and Melbourne, Australia. He received B.Sc. (Hons) and M.Sc. degrees in Chemistry from Monash University, Melbourne, where he worked in the laboratory of Prof. Ron Brown. In 1989, he obtained his Ph.D. in Chemistry from Carnegie-Mellon University, working with Prof. John Pople. After postdoctoral research with Dr. John Tully at Bell Laboratories, Head-Gordon became an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1992. He was promoted to Full Professor in 2000, and holds a joint appointment in the Chemical Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He was a NSF Young Investigator (1993), a Packard Fellow (1995), and a Sloan Fellow (1995), received the Medal of the International Society of Quantum Molecular Sciences (1998), and was a Miller Research Professor (2001−2002). His research centers on the development and application of electronic structure methods and their realization as practical computer algorithms, with particular interests in linear scaling, excited states, and electron correlation.},

By appropriate choice of the shape and size of metallic nanoparticles, the kind of adsorbed molecules and the wavelength of the exciting light, it is possible to achieve enhancement of the intensity of Raman scattering equal to 1012-1014. This means that only some molecules inside the exciting light beam are sufficient to record the Raman spectrum. Electromagnetic and chemical mechanisms of enhancement of Raman scattered light and methods of roughness investigation of surfaces exhibiting this promising phenomenon are described in this paper.},

Metallic properties such as delocalization of electrons in bulk metals which imbue them with high electrical and thermal conductivity, light reflectivity and mechanical ductility may be wholly or partially absent in metal nanoclusters, while new properties develop. We review modern synthetic methods used to form metal nanoclusters. The focus of this critical review is solution based chemical synthesis methods which produce fully dispersed clusters. Control of cluster size and surface chemistry using inverse micelles is emphasized. Two classes of metals are discussed, transition metals such as Au and Pt, and base metals such as Co, Fe and Ni. The optical and catalytic properties of the former are discussed and the magnetic properties of the latter are given as examples of unexpected new size-dependent properties of nanoclusters. We show how classical surface science methods of characterization augmented by chemical analysis methods such as liquid chromatography can be used to provide feedback for improvements in synthetic protocols. Characterization of metal clusters by their optical, catalytic, or magnetic behavior also provides insights leading to improvements in synthetic methods. The collective physical properties of closely interacting clusters are reviewed followed by speculation on future technical applications of clusters.},

  abstract = {Organometallic complexes have long been known to display a wide variety of dynamic stereochemical processes. Classic examples of such processes include the exchange of axial and equatorial environments in trigonal bipyramidal complexes, such as Fe(CO), and the migration of the metal moiety round the periphery of the cyclopentadiene ring in [small eta]-bound Cp complexes. The systematic study of fluxional processes is of interest because it can not only help provide a detailed, quantitative 'picture' of the bonding between the metals and ligands involved, but it can also help to rationalise chemical reactivity patterns. The introduction of chirality into organometallic complexes, usually in the form of a non-racemic chiral ligand, has led to an explosion in the importance such species, particularly with regard to their applications in organic functional group transformations. The presence of a chiral centre can also provide an excellent spectroscopic handle on the complex in question, enabling both novel fluxional processes to be observed and new light to be shed on old (unresolved) problems. In this (101 references) the literature on metal-centred fluxional rearrangements in chiral transition and main group organometallic complexes is reviewed, complementing the recent review by Faller (see reference ).},

ROA spectra contain a wealth of information on tertiary folding, secondary structure and even the orientation of individual residues in proteins and nucleic acids. Extension of ROA to an even wider range of samples could be facilitated by coupling its structural sensitivity to the low-concentration sensitivity provided by plasmon resonance enhancement. This leads to the new technique of surface enhanced ROA, or SEROA, which is complementary to both SERS and ROA.

The calculations use a new implementation of a TDDFT linear response module in a locally modified version of NWChem for the TDDFT calculations. This code enables us to explore the influence of basis set effects and different choices of density functionals on the Raman spectra, including studies of correlation-consistent basis sets, and of hybrid density functionals. Previous work had employed the BP non-hybrid GGA functional, which works already quite well. Hybrid-GGA functionals such as B3LYP are better at reproducing the experimental spectra of the pyridine silver complex. However for relatively inexpensive calculations, the combination of BP with the DZVP basis set is able to provide semi-quantitative accuracy at reasonable cost, especially in conjunction with an appropriate pseudopotential for the silver atom.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: In this report, we detail our current work towards developing a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based sensor for in vivo glucose detection. Despite years of innovations in the development of blood glucose monitors, there remains a need for accurate continuous glucose sensors to provide care to rising numbers of diagnosed diabetes patients and mitigate secondary health complications associated with this metabolic disorder. Methods: SERS is a highly specific and sensitive optical technique suitable for direct detection of glucose. The SERS effect is highly distance dependent, thus the glucose molecules need to be within a few nanometers or adsorbed to an SERS-active surface. In our sensor, this is achieved with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) that facilitates reversible interactions between glucose molecules and the surface. The amount of glucose near the surface is proportional to its concentration in the surrounding environment. Results: We determined that the SAM-functionalized surface is stable for at least 10 days and provides rapid, reversible partitioning. In vitro experiments in bovine plasma as well as in vivo experiments in rats demonstrated quantitative detection. Conclusions: We show successful use of the SERS glucose sensor in rats, making it the first in vivo SERS sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrate free space transdermal detection of a SERS signal through the rat's skin as an initial step toward developing a transcutaneous sensor.},

  abstract = {The optical response of free and matrix-embedded gold metal clusters AuN is investigated in the framework of the time-dependent local-density-approximation (TDLDA). The characteristics of the surface plasmon resonance are carefully analyzed as a function of the model parameters and the particle radius. The strong influence of the frequency-dependence of the 5d core-electron dielectric function in the vicinity of the interband threshold is emphasized. The size evolution of the Mie-frequency in free gold clusters exhibits a noticeable blue-shift trend as the particle size decreases, much stronger than in silver clusters. The width and shape of the resonance, essentially ruled by the decay via the interband transitions, are found closely correlated to the imaginary component of the core-electron dielectric function. In presence of a surrounding matrix the blue-shift trend is largely rubbed out. Agreement with recent experimental results on size-selected gold clusters embedded in an alumina matrix may be achieved by taking into account the porosity effects at the metal/matrix interface. The comparison with the predictions of classical models is also provided.},

  abstract = {Theoretical and experimental information on the shape and morphology of bare and passivated gold clusters is fundamental to predict and understand their electronic, optical, and other physical and chemical properties. An effective theoretical approach to determine the lowest-energy configuration (global minimum) and the structures of low energy isomers (local minima) of clusters is to combine genetic algorithms and many-body potentials (to perform global structural optimizations), and first-principles density functional theory (to confirm the stability and energy ordering of the local minima). The main trend emerging from structural optimizations of bare Au clusters in the size range of 12-212 atoms indicates that many topologically interesting low-symmetry, disordered structures exist with energy near or below the lowest-energy ordered isomer. For example, chiral structures have been obtained as the lowest-energy isomers of bare Au 28 and Au 55 clusters, whereas in the size-range of 75-212 atoms, defective Marks decahedral structures are nearly degenerate in energy with the ordered symmetrical isomers. For methylthiol-passivated gold nanoclusters [Au 28(SCH 3) 16 and Au 38(SCH 3) 24], density functional structural relaxations have shown that the ligands are not only playing the role of passivating molecules, but their effect is strong enough to distort the metal cluster structure. In this work, a theoretical approach to characterize and quantify chirality in clusters, based on the Hausdorff chirality measure, is described. After calculating the index of chirality in bare and passivated gold clusters, it is found that the thiol monolayer induces or increases the degree of chirality of the metallic core. We also report simulated high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images which show that defects in decahedral gold nanoclusters, with size between 1-2 nm, can be detected using currently available experimental HRTEM techniques.},

Unfortunately, for large class of equations, where, for instance, Bi-CG performs well, the convergence of Bi-CGSTAB stagnates. This was observed specifically case of discretized advection dominated PDE's. The stagnation is due to the fact that for this type of equations the matrix has almost pure imaginary eigenvalues. With his Bi-CGStab2 algorithm Gutknecht attempted avoid this stagnation. Here, generalize the Bi-CGSTAB algorithm further, and overcome some shortcomings of BiCGStab2. In some sense, the new algorithm combines GMRES($\ell$) and Bi-CG and profits from both.},

  abstract = {Hair dyes and their ingredients have moderate to low acute toxicity. Human poisoning accidents are rare and have only been reported following oral ingestion. Contact sensitisation to hair dyes has been a safety issue, mainly as a consequence of unprotected professional exposure. Although the use of hair dyes has dramatically increased in industrialised countries during the last decades, the prevalence of sensitisation to hair dyes in the general and professional populations has stabilised or declined. In vitro genotoxicity tests on hair dye ingredients frequently had positive results, although their correlation with in vivo carcinogenicity for the chemical class of oxidative hair dye ingredients (aromatic amines) is uncertain. Positive in vivo genotoxicity results on hair dyes are rare. Studies in man found no evidence of genotoxic effects of hair dyes or their ingredients. On the basis of mechanistic studies, some in vivo positive hair dye ingredients (p-aminophenol, Lawsone) have been shown to pose no or negligible risk to human health. Although a recent case-control epidemiology study suggested an association of hair dye use and bladder cancer, a number of other studies, including prospective investigations on large populations, found no or negative correlations for bladder or other cancers. Although in vivo topical carcinogenicity studies on hair dye ingredients or commercial formulations yielded no evidence for systemic toxicity or carcinogenicity, oral carcinogenicity studies on hair dye ingredients at oral doses up to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) suggested that some ingredients are carcinogenic in rodents. Human systemic exposure to various 14C-labelled oxidative hair dyes under conditions of use was below 1.0% of the amount applied. Conservative risk assessments suggested no or negligible cancer risk, including for ingredients that were found to be positive in oral carcinogenicity studies. The results of reproductive toxicity studies and epidemiological investigations suggested that hair dyes and their ingredients pose no risk of adverse reproductive effects. In conclusion, the weight of evidence suggests that consumer or professional exposure to hair dyes poses no carcinogenic or other human health risks.},

We discuss various devices, low bit-density memory circuits, and ultra-high density memory circuits that utilize the electrochemical switching characteristics of these molecules in conjunction with novel patterning methods.

  abstract = {Despite widespread use for more than two decades, the SERS phenomenon has defied accurate physical and chemical explanation. The relative contributions from electronic and chemical mechanisms are difficult to quantify and are often not reproduced under nominally similar experimental conditions. This work has used electromagnetic modelling to predict the Raman enhancement expected from three configurations: metal nanoparticles, structured metal surfaces, and sharp metal tips interacting with metal surfaces. In each case, parameters such as artefact size, artefact separation and incident radiation wavelength have been varied and the resulting electromagnetic field modelled. This has yielded an electromagnetic description of these configurations with predictions of the maximum expected Raman enhancement, and hence a prediction of the optimum substrate configuration for the SERS process. When combined with experimental observations of the dependence of Raman enhancement with changing ionic strength, the modelling results have allowed a novel estimate of the size of the chemical enhancement mechanism to be produced.},

The contributions to the total bonding energy between Ni(C0)3 and L from u donation and a back-donation are evaluated by the Hartree-Fock-Slater transition-state method, and the same method is used to optimize the Ni-L bond distances. Calculations on the stretching frequency vco of carbon monoxide complexed to Ni(CO)3 showed that vco is decreased by the a back-donation but is increased by the steric interaction energy between Ni(C0)3 and CO. Thus the decrease in vco is not a reliable measure of the extent of a back-bonding in the metal-ligand bond. The calculated influence on vco from u donation was negligible.},

  abstract = {Resonance Raman spectra are reported for Ru(II) complexes of octaethylporphyrin (OEP) and tetraphenylporphine (TPP) with pyridine, methanol, and CO axial ligands, using both B- and Q-band excitation. For Ru(II)OEP(CO)(MeOH) the porphyrin skeletal mode frequencies above 1370 cm-1 agree remarkably well with the values calculated on the basis of the porphyrin core size by using parameters derived earlier for iron protoporphyrin complexes. These frequencies shift both positively and negatively when the CO is replaced by pyridine due to r-back-donation from Ru to the porphyrin pi* orbitals. The shift pattern is the same as that observed for the bis(imidazo1e) adduct of iron(II) protoporphyrin, relative to the core size predictions, and the extent of the shifts is very similar in the two cases. Thus, pi-back-bonding to the porphyrin appears to be quantitatively similar for Ru(II) and Fe(II). pi-Back-bonding shifts are also reported for Ru(II)TPP(py),. For Ru(II)OEP(CO)(py) the Ru-CO stretching, Ru-C-O bending, and C-O stretching modes are observed at 513, 578, and 1930 cm-1. For Fe(II) porphyrins, the M-CO and C-O frequencies are somewhat lower and higher, respectively, implying greater back-donation to the bound CO for Ru(II) than for Fe(II).},

Over the wavelength range 820-900 nm, both complexes displayed two-photon excitation as observed by a quadratic dependence of the emission intensity on incident power. Steady state emission and time-resolved frequency-domain intensity decay measurements revealed that two-photon excitation of each complex resulted in the same emission spectra and single-exponential decays as observed for one-photon excitation at a variety of temperatures in different solvents. The two-photon excitation cross section of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ measured at 880 nm was determined to be 4.3 x 10-50 cm4 s/photon.

  abstract = {18O-isotope-labeling studies have led to the conclusion that there exist two major pathways for water oxidation catalyzed by dimeric ruthenium ions of the general type cis,cis-[L2RuIII(OH2)]2O4+. We have proposed that both pathways involve concerted addition of H and OH fragments derived from H2O to the complexes in their four-electron-oxidized states, i.e., [L2RuV(O)]2O4+, ultimately generating bound peroxy intermediates that decay with the evolution of O2. The pathways differ primarily in the site of addition of the OH fragment, which is either a ruthenyl O atom or a bipyridine ligand. In the former case, water addition is thought to give rise to a critical intermediate whose structure is L2RuIV(OH)ORuIV(OOH)L24+; the structures of intermediates involved in the other pathway are less well defined but may involve bipyridine OH adducts of the type L2RuV(O)ORuIV(OH)(L*OH)L4+, which could react further to generate unstable dioxetanes or similar endoperoxides. Published experimental and theoretical support for these pathways is reviewed within the broader context of water oxidation catalysis and related reactions reported for other diruthenium and group 8 monomeric diimine-based catalysts. New experiments that are designed to probe the issue of bipyridine ligand ``noninnocenc'' in catalysis are described. Specifically, the relative contributions of the two pathways have been shown to correlate with substituent effects in 4,4'- and 5,5'-substituted bipyridine complexes in a manner consistent with the formation of a reactive OH-adduct intermediate in one of the pathways, and the formation of OH-bipyridine adducts during catalytic turnover has been directly confirmed by optical spectroscopy. Finally, a photosensitized system for catalyzed water oxidation has been developed that allows assessment of the catalytic efficiencies of the complex ions under neutral and alkaline conditions; these studies show that the ions are far better catalysts than had previously been assumed based upon reported catalytic parameters obtained with strong oxidants in acidic media.},

  abstract = {The lowest energy metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands found in ambient solutions of [Ru(NH3)4(Y-py)2]2+ and [Ru(L)2(bpy)2]+ complexes (Y-py a pyridine ligand and (L)n a substituted acetonylacetonate, halide, am(m)ine, etc.) consist of two partly resolved absorption envelopes, MLCTlo and MLCThi. The lower energy absorption envelope, MLCTlo, in these spectra has the larger amplitude for the bis-(Y-py) complexes, but the smaller amplitude for the bis-bpy the complexes. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) approaches have been used to model 14 bis-bpy, three bis-(Y-py), and three mono-bpy complexes. The modeling indicates that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of each bis-(Y-py) complex corresponds to the antisymmetric combination of individual Y-py acceptor orbitals and that the transition involving the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO (HOMO->LUMO) is the dominant contribution to MLCTlo in this class of complexes. The LUMO of each bis-bpy complex that contains a C2 symmetry axis also corresponds largely to the antisymmetric combination of individual ligand acceptor orbitals, while the LUMOs are more complex when there is no C2 axis; furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO_>LUMO and HOMO->LUMO+1 transitions is too small (<1000 cm-1) to resolve in the spectra of the bis-bpy complexes in ambient solutions. Relatively weak MLCTlo absorption contributions are found for all of the [Ru(L)2(bpy)2]m+ complexes examined, but they are experimentally best defined in the spectra of the (L)2 = X-acac complexes. TD-DFT modeling of the HOMO->LUMO transition of [Ru(L)4bpy]m+ complexes indicates that it is too weak to be detected and occurs at significantly lower energy (about 3000-5000 cm-1) than the observed MLCT absorptions. Since the chemical properties of MLCT excited states are generally correlated with the HOMO and/or LUMO properties of the complexes, such very weak HOMO->LUMO transitions can complicate the use of spectroscopic information in their assessment. As an example, it is observed that the correlation lines between the absorption energy maxima and the differences in ground state oxidation and reduction potentials (E1/2) have much smaller slopes for the bis-bpy than the mono-bpy complexes. However, the observed MLCTlo and the calculated HOMO->LUMO transitions of bis-bpy complexes correlate very similarly with E1/2 and this indicates that it is the low energy and small amplitude component of the lowest energy MLCT absorption band that is most appropriately correlated with excited state chemistry, not the absorption maximum as is often assumed.},

  abstract = {Single molecule Raman spectroscopy provides information on individual molecules with vibrational-level resolution. The unique mechanisms leading to the huge Raman cross-section enhancement necessary for single molecule sensitivity are under intense investigation in several laboratories. We recently published an analysis of large spectral fluctuations in single molecule spectra of Rhodamine 6G on silver surfaces. The appearance of the fluctuations in two particular vibrational bands, and their dependence on several parameters, suggested that they originate in a charge transfer interaction of an adsorbed molecule with the surface. We argued that the fluctuations are due to variations of the local work function at the position of the molecule. In the current paper the fluctuations are further analyzed in terms of the intensity ratio between a fluctuating and a quiescent band, and it is found that the distribution of this ratio is independent of laser power, unlike the correlation time of the fluctuations. We show that a simple model, based on the energetics of charge transfer, can be used to extract the local work function distribution from the intensity ratio distribution. In a second experiment, single molecule spectra are collected from colloids immersed in water and in glycerol and a threefold decrease in fluctuation rate is found in the more viscous fluid. This indicates that surface dynamics are indeed responsible for the fluctuations, involving the motion of the adsorbed molecule and possibly also that of surface silver atoms around it.},

  abstract = {Since the mid-1990s good quality surface-enhanced Raman spectra have been obtained from many transition metal (TM) electrodes. It has been observed quite often that SERS band intensities, i.e., the relative intensities of different vibrational modes, of the adsorbate are very sensitive to the nature of the metal. Since transition metals interact with adsorbed molecules much more strongly than the typical SERS substrates, i.e., Au, Ag, and Cu, it is desirable to give a detailed and quantitative explanation of the spectroscopic behavior on TM electrodes. In the present study, a hybrid density functional approach with 6-311+G{*}{*}/LanL2DZ basis sets and the B3LYP nonlocal exchange-correlation functionals has been used for the Raman intensity analysis on totally symmetric modes of pyridine adsorbed at transition metal electrodes, e.g., iron, cobalt, nickel, palladium, and platinum. Among all studied metal electrodes, iron and cobalt are predicted to be the most effective SERS substrates involving chemical enhancement, a result in good agreement with the experiments. The chemical bonding enhancement plays a role in pyridine interaction with the transition metal electrodes. The charge transfer enhancement as the most common chemical mechanism is also discussed for comparison.},

But which of the many gradient-corrected density functionals should be preferred a priori? We make a graphical comparison of the gradient dependencies of some popular approximations, discussing the exact formal conditions which each obeys and identifying which conditions seem most important. For the exchange energy, there is little formal or practical reason to choose among the Perdew-Wang 86, Becke 88, or Perdew-Wang 91 functionals. But, for the correlation energy, the best formal properties are displayed by the nonempirical PW91 correlation functional. Furthermore, the real-space foundation of PW91 yields an insight into the character of the gradient expansion which suggests that PW91 should work especially well for solids. Indeed, while improving dissociation energies over LSD, PW91 remains the most `'local'' of the gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functionals and, thus, the least likely to overcorrect the subtle errors of LSD for solids. To show that our analysis of spin-unpolarized functionals is sufficient, we also compute spin-polarization energies for atoms, finding PW91 values only slightly more negative than LSD values.},

We discuss the coupling-constant dependence of the atomization energy and why exchange errors of the functionals are greater than exchange-correlation errors. This fact helps to justify hybrid schemes which mix some exact exchange with density functional approximations for exchange and correlation. It is shown that the biggest errors in the atomization energies occur when there is a strong interaction between different electron pairs, which vanishes upon atomization. We argue that the amount of exchange character of a molecular property, such as the atomization energy, depends on the property itself. We define an exact mixing coefficient b, which measures this exchange character, and show that both LSD and PW91 typically overestimate this quantity. Thus, nonempirical hybrid schemes which approximate this quantity by its LSD or PW91 value typically do not improve the exchange-correlation energy.},

  abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/(SICI)1097-461X(1998)68:1<1::AID-QUA1>3.3.CO;2-F It is demonstrated that frequency-dependent response functions can conveniently be derived from the time-averaged quasienergy. The variational criteria for the quasienergy determines the time-evolution of the wave-function parameters and the time-averaged time-dependent Hellmann\^aFeynman theorem allows an identification of response functions as derivatives of the quasienergy. The quasienergy therefore plays the same role as the usual energy in time-independent theory, and the same techniques can be used to obtain computationally tractable expressions for response properties, as for energy derivatives in time-independent theory. This includes the use of the variational Lagrangian technique for obtaining expressions for molecular properties in accord with the 2n+1 and 2n+2 rules. The derivation of frequency-dependent response properties becomes a simple extension of variational perturbation theory to a Fourier component variational perturbation theory. The generality and simplicity of this approach are illustrated by derivation of linear and higher-order response functions for both exact and approximate wave functions and for both variational and nonvariational wave functions. Examples of approximate models discussed in this article are coupled-cluster, self-consistent field, and second-order M\~A\c\ ller\^aPlesset perturbation theory.

The functional forms can be divided into three categories: (1) the local spin density (LSD) approximation, (2) generalized gradient approximations (GGAs), and (3) meta-GGAs. In addition to the spin densities and their first gradients, the input to a meta-GGA includes other semilocal information such as Laplacians of the spin densities or orbital kinetic energy densities. We present a way to visualize meta-GGA nonlocality which generalizes that for GGA nonlocality, and which stresses the different meta-GGA descriptions of iso-orbital and orbital overlap regions of space. While some of the tested approximations were constructed semiempirically with many parameters fitted to chemical data, others were constructed to incorporate key properties of the exact exchange-correlation energy. The latter functionals perform well for both small and extended systems, with the best performance achieved by a meta-GGA which recovers the correct gradient expansion. While the semiempirical functionals can achieve high accuracy for atoms and molecules, they are typically less accurate for surfaces and solids.},

A complete characterization of their structure, binding energies, and type of bonding is obtained. Dissociation is clearly favored for the disulfide with subsequent formation of strongly bound thiolates, in agreement with experimental evidence, whereas thiolates resulting from S-H bond cleavage in thiols can coexist with the adsorbed ldquointactrdquo species and become favored if accompanied by the formation of molecular hydrogen. New calculations are also presented for the thiolates and the disulfide on a 38-atom gold cluster. Differences and similarities of the bonding on the cluster and on the surface are described in detail.},

The model has been parameterized for the elements H, C, N, O, F, and Cl from quantum chemical calculations of the molecular polarizability and dipole moment for 161 molecules at the Hartree-Fock level. The atomic charge has been divided into a nuclear charge and an electronic contribution, which also allows for modeling the permanent molecular dipole moment. Results are presented for polyenes. Excellent agreement with quantum chemical calculations is obtained for the components of the polarizability perpendicular to the chain, but the results are less satisfying for the component along the chain. An inherent deficiency of using atomic capacitancies for large molecules and long chains is discussed.},

  abstract = {In this work we investigate the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of [Co(en)(3)](3+) in water, using the discrete solvent reaction field (DRF) model. The DRF model is a polarizable quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) model. The implementation of the DRF model for CD spectra calculations based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is presented. The combination of DRF with TDDFT allows for a computationally attractive solution for calculating chirooptical properties of molecules in solution when explicit solvent structures are of interest. Using a mixed coarse/fine-grained parallel computation, we show that average CD spectra from snapshots of the solvent structure can be obtained routinely. Classical polarizable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to obtain the solvent structure around the [Co(en)(3)](3+) (en = ethyldiamine) solute. We show that the final spectrum converges quickly with respect to the number of configurations. The DRF results were compared with results obtained from the much simpler conductor-like screening model (COSMO). Both models predicted similar blue shifts of the CD bands, but none of the models is in perfect agreement with the experiments. For instance, the calculated intensities are larger than what is found experimentally if reasonable empirical line width parameters are applied. From the DRF computations, we further show that almost all the solvent effects arise from ground-state solvation. Thus, ignoring the dynamic solvent response is a good approximation for a system like [Co(en)(3)](3+), where the solute is highly charged and the solvent is very polar.},

The electronic structures of optimized 1-2 nm nanoparticles show well-developed band structures with essentially no electronic bandgap defect states. Significant bandgap broadening due to quantum size effects is observed as the size of the nanocrystals is reduced from 2 nm to 1 nm in diameter, but further bandgap widening is limited by increasingly severe competing surface defect sites as the particles become smaller than 1 nm in diameter. The applicability of the TiO2 nanocrystals in modeling the electronic structure and electronic coupling at dye-sensitized TiO2 nanocrystal interfaces has been investigated by attachment of pyridine to one of the nanoparticle models via phosphonic or carboxylic acid anchor groups.},

These molecules have agostic interactions of varying strength, and it is concluded that this strength is very well reflected in the charge capacitances of the systems. In accordance with the definition of agostic interactions it is therefor concluded that the charge capacitance holds information about the strength of covalent interactions.

The results obtained for both the gas phase and solvated systems indicate significant changes in the electronic structure and the Raman spectra of molecules like formic acid and dopamine, when they are adsorbed on small TiO2 nanoparticles. A number of distinctive features that are determined by the formation of a charge-transfer complex at the nanoparticle-molecule interface can be noted in the Raman spectra. Both the spectra and the electronic properties are strongly size dependent and are also sensitive to the presence of the solvent and the nature of adsorbate interaction.

  abstract = {This review describes investigations into the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. It is divided into two parts: 1) LSPR of silver nanoparticle arrays and its interaction with resonant adsorbates and 2) single-nanoparticle LSPR spectroscopy and sensing of two specific nanoparticle geometries: triangular nanoprisms and nanocubes. Part I addresses the problem of strong coupling between the plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle and the molecular electronic resonances of the adsorbates. In particular, it was shown that the shift in the LSPR wavelength induced by resonant adsorbates binding to nanoparticles is highly dependent upon the relative spectral position of the LSPR to the molecular resonance. This finding was applied to study the electronic structures of resonant adsorbates on metallic nanostructures. Furthermore, an optical nanosensor was designed to study low molecular weight substrate molecule interaction with cytochrome P450 proteins. Part II shows that the LSPR spectra of single nanoparticles are highly sensitive to all details of their geometry. These geometric details play an important role in determining the utility of a nanoparticle as a sensor. It was demonstrated that nanoprisms have a 1 nm per CH2 unit greater sensitivity to the binding of molecular adsorbates than truncated tetrahedral arrays despite being five times thinner, suggesting they will be excellent candidates for sensing large biomolecules. It was further shown, for the case of the nanocubes, that the energy of LSPR modes are not simply sensitive to their environments, but that the environment can actually affect the number of modes observed in a nanoparticle's LSPR spectrum. A figure of merit (FOM) has been defined for single-nanoparticle sensors, and the nanocubespsila high-energy peaks were shown to have the highest-value FOM measured to date.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an efficient technique for solving a dense complex-symmetric linear system of equations arising in the method of moments (MoM) formulation. To illustrate the application of the method, we consider a finite array of scatterers, which gives rise to a large number of unknowns. The solution procedure utilizes preconditioned transpose-free QMR (PTFQMR) iterations and computes the matrix-vector products by employing a compressed impedance matrix. The compression is achieved by reduced-rank representation of the off-diagonal blocks, based on a partial-QR decomposition, which is followed by an iterative refinement. Both the preconditioning and the compression steps take advantage of the block structure of the matrix. The convergence of the iterative procedure is investigated and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to that achieved by other schemes. The effectiveness of the preconditioner and the degree of matrix compression are quantified. Finite arrays of variable shape and sizes are considered, and it is demonstrated that the ability to solve large problems using this technique enables one to evaluate the edge effects in the finite array. Such array is basically flat and periodic, but the algorithm is still efficient when variation with strict periodicity or flatness exists},

  abstract = {In computational electromagnetics, the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is used to reduce the computational complexity of the matrix vector product operations. In iteratively solving the dense linear systems arising from discretized hybrid integral equations, the sparse approximate inverse (SAI) preconditioning technique is employed to accelerate the convergence rate of the Krylov iterations. We show that a good quality SAI preconditioner can be constructed by using the near part matrix numerically generated in the MLFMA. The main purpose of this study is to show that this class of the SAI preconditioners are effective with the MLFMA and can reduce the number of Krylov iterations substantially. Our experimental results indicate that the SAI preconditioned MLFMA maintains the computational complexity of the MLFMA, but converges a lot faster, thus effectively reduces the overall simulation time.},

  abstract = {A new fast dipole method (FDM) is proposed for the electromagnetic scattering from arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional (3D), electrically large, perfect electric conducting (PEC) targets in free space based on the concept of equivalent dipole-moment method (EDM) and the fast multipole method (FMM). The electric-ﬁeld, magnetic-ﬁeld and combined-ﬁeld integral equations (CFIE) for this algorithm have been developed and implemented. Although the basic acceleration idea in the FDM has been borrowed from the FMM, the speciﬁc implementation of these two algorithms is completely different. In the FDM, a simple Taylor’s series expansion of the distance between two interacting equivalent dipoles is used, which transforms the impedance element into another aggregation-translation-disaggregation form naturally. Furthermore, this algorithm is very simple for numerical implementation for it does not involve the calculation of a number of Bessel functions, Legendre functions for the addition theorem and complex integral operators. The FDM can achieve   computational complexity and memory requirement, where is the number of unknowns. Numerical results are presented to validate the efﬁciency and accu},

  abstract = {The public-domain &psi;-Mag toolset uses generic-programming techniques to provide the computational magnetic-materials community an excellent opportunity for code reuse without loss of efficiency. &psi;-Mag provides a flexible implementation of the fast multipole method (FMM) for dipole-dipole calculations that does not depend on the geometry of the problem and is suitable for high-performance, parallel computers. Theoretically, the execution time for such a calculation should grow only linearly with the number of spins, and this is confirmed here for up to order 10<sup>5</sup> spins. In addition, the implementation efficiently uses a large number of processors. For a test case of 64 000 dipoles, the measured speedup is over 25 for 40 processors on a four-processor-per-node IBM SP; this compares quite favorably with less-flexible FMM implementations. The generic implementation allows for easy changes of the basis functions used to expand potentials specific to particular applications, facilitating direct comparison of different approaches. Here, the traditional spherical-harmonic expansions are compared to Cartesian expansions which reflect the cubic symmetries of meshes used in typical micromagnetic simulations.},

Trends in values of $\Delta\nu_{1/2}$, $\lambda_{max}$, and $K_{eq}$ for TCNE complexes of PhCH$_3$, Ph$_2$CH$_2$, Ph$_3$CH, and Ph$_4$C are interpreted in terms of hyperconjugative, inductive, and steric effects. Striking similarities in the spectra of TCNE complexes of Ph$_4$C, Ph$_4$Si, Ph$_4$Ge, Ph$_4$Sn, and Ph$_4$Pb indicate that there is no appreciable pa - da bonding between the phenyl groups and central atoms and that the energies of the phenyl a orbitals are unaffected by the size or electronegativities of the central atoms. Spectral characteristics and association constants for dichloromethane solutions of 10 1:1 complexes of arylamines with TCNE in dichloromethane are reported. These complexes generally exhibit two absorbance bands. The low wavelength maxima, AI (385-415 nm), arise from phenyl a2 orbitals. The high wavelength maxima, A2 (580-820 nm), arise from b, orbitals, which are strongly conjugated with the unbonded electron pair of the central atom. Di- and triarylamines form stable complexes with TCNE, whereas monoarylamines react irreversibly with TCNE. Ph$_3$P reacts rapidly with TCNE in dichloromethane to yield a 1:2 adduct. TCNE also reacts rapidly with 2-, 3-, and 4-TOl$_3$P but forms a 1:l complex with Ms,P which has Lx41 6 nm. Ph$_3$As, Ph$_3$Sb, and Ph$_3$Bi form 1:1 complexes with TCNE which have two overlapping absorbance bands. The low wavelength bands, AI (385-405 nm), arise from a2 orbitals, whereas the high wavelength bands, A2 (515-545 nm), arise from n orbitals energized by pa - da conjugation.},

  abstract = {The first total differential resonance Raman cross-section excitation profiles have been measured throughout an electronic transition of a simple aromatic molecule. The excitation profiles of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosinate, and tryptophan were measured between 217 and 600 nm. The mechanism for resonance enhancement for each of these benzene derivatives is discussed. The Y, symmetric ring stretch at 750 cm-1 in phenylalanine derives its preresonance enhancement from the BGb transitions, while the other vibrations are enhanced by the La transition at ca. 210 nm. The excitation profiles for tyrosinate indicate that the L, state has little charge-transfer character, while the Lb and states further in the UV have significant charge-transfer character. The excitation profile data are used to assign the resonance enhanced vibrations. The relationship between resonance enhancement of a vibrational mode, the atomic displacements in the vibration, and the molecular electronic transition is examined. The crass sections are used to determine the optimal excitation wavelength required to selectively enhance particular aromatic amino acids in proteins. The resonance Raman spectra of lysozyme are discussed. Photochemical and optical saturation processes which commonly occur with pulsed laser excitation can change the apparent contributions of aromatic amino acid intensities in the Raman spectra. Transient species can also form and alter the measured Raman spectra. These processes can cause artifactual Raman spectral changes.},

  abstract = {Solvent effects on the electronic structure of a series of para-substituted triphenylmethane dyes have been investigated using polarized Raman scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy, with interpretation aided by the results of intermediate neglect of differential overlap (INDO) molecular orbital calculations. While the evidence points to D3 symmetry for the triphenylmethane cation in solution, resonance Raman and fluorescence data indicate that the symmetry of the substituted dyes is lowered by an interaction with the solvent. Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations support the idea that interaction of a charge or dipole with one of the amino groups could be responsible for breaking the symmetry of the crystal violet and parafuchsin ion, thus lifting the degeneracy of the excited electronic state which gives rise to absorption of visible light. The splitting of the excited electronic state shows up in the polarization dependence of both the resonance Raman spectra and the fluorescence emission. INDO calculations as well as fluorescence measurements argue against the existence of two ground-state conformations, such as a symmetric and an unsymmetric propeller form, as has been previously suggested.},

  abstract = {Chirality is a property that is independent of its physical and chemical manifestations. It is therefore possible to quantify chirality without any reference to pseudoscalar observables. In this paper we propose a new measure of chirality that is based on Hausdorffs concept of distances between sets and that is a natural choice as a measure for molecular models that represent structures as sets of atomic coordinates. This Huusdorff chirality measure, a continuous and similarity-invariant function of an object's shape, is zero if and only if the object is achiral. We have applied this measure to study the chirality of tetrahedral shapes-classical models of tetracoordinate carbon atoms-and have identified the extremal (most chiral) shapes for every chiral subsymmetry of Td that can be realized by a tetrahedron. Our calculations show that the degree of chirality of the extremal objects increases with a decrease in symmetry, although the most symmetric chiral tetrahedron, with 4 symmetry, already possesses 87% of the maximal chirality value available for tetrahedra, and that the shape of the most chiral tetrahedron, with C, symmetry, is very close to that of the most chiral C2 tetrahedron. The properties and the applicability of the Hausdorff chirality measure are compared with those of other measures of chirality that are based on common-volume or root-mean-square approaches.},

Nonresonant Raman spectra of the complex and its perdeuterated derivative in the solid state have also been obtained with excitation at 1064 nm. Absorption of light within the charge-transfer band results in electron transfer from hexamethylbenzene to tetracyanoethylene to form a radical-ion pair. The geometry change along each vibrational mode as a result of this photoinduced electron transfer and the accompanying internal reorganization energies have been determined through quantitative simulation of the absorption spectrum and absolute resonance Raman intensities using time-dependent wavepacket propagation methods. The largest individual contributions to the total measured reorganization energy of approximately 3500 cm^{-1} arise from the presumed donor-acceptor intermolecular stretching mode at 165 cm^{-1} and the C=C stretch of tetracyanoethylene at 1551 cm^{-1}, with smaller contributions from other modes localized on both tetracyanoethylene and hexamethylbenzene. The importance of these results for understanding trends in the rates of nonphotochemical return electron transfer is discussed.},

Calculations on the two abstraction reactions A ('CH, + CH4 - CHI + 'CH,) and B ('CH, + CH3CI - CH4 + 'CH2C1) afforded the activation energies A = 11.7 kcal/mol and B = 8.5 kcal/mol, which compare favorably with the experimental activation energies of 14.1 kcal/mol for A and 9.4 kcal/mol for B. The local density approximation (LDA), without nonlocal correction, afforded a qualitative incorrect description of the two processes with a double-well reaction profile and too small barriers of 1.9 kcal/mol for A and -2.1 kcal/mol for B. Nonlocal (NL) calculations on the dissociation process C (H2C0 - H2 + CO) afforded barrier and transition-state structures in close agreement with the best estimate from ab initio calculations. The NL barrier of 75 kcal/mol differs only slightly from the LDA estimate of 74 kcal/mol, and nonlocal corrections are not important for this type of reaction. Nonlocal calculations on the isomerization reactions D (CH3CN - CNCH,) gave an activation energy of 37.5 kcal/mol, which is close to the experimental value of 38.5 kcal/mol. Studies were also carried out on the isomerization processes D' (HCN - CNH) and E (HOC' - HCO') for which experimental estimates are unavailable. The calculated barriers were 27.6 kcal/mol for D' and 26.0 kcal/mol for E. The nonlocal corrections were of minor importance for the reactions D, D', and E. It is concluded that nonlocal density functional theory provides the same accuracy in kinetic studies as the highest level of ab initio theory applied to the reactions A to E.},

The band shapes and the ratios of sharp scattering to broad fluorescence are explored as a function of the laser detuning from resonance, the parameters describing the solvent oscillator, and the excited-state lifetime, and direct comparisons with the stochastic theory, which does not contain the solvent-induced Stokes shift, are made. The relationship between the optical band shapes and the nuclear Franck-Condon factor for nonphotochemical electron transfer processes is also discussed within the Brownian oscillator model for the solvation coordinate. The limits of applicability of the ``high-temperature'' limit for the Brownian oscillator are established.},

The RR bands are assigned to the porphyrin in-plane and out-of-plane modes as well as to the internal vibrations of substituents on the basis of the observed isotope shifts. The issue of vinyl substituent effects is revisited, and bands are assigned to the 2- or 4-vinyl group from selective deuteration shifts. Contributions of the aliphatic propionate groups are also revealed in the RR spectrum.

The excitation profiles (the Raman intensities as a function of excitation wavelength) are obtained using the SO3 stretch of the triflate ion as an internal standard. The ratios of the Raman intensities are not constant with different excitation wavelengths. This unusual observation is attributed to interference between two overlapping electronic states of the molecule. The electronic states are observed in the low-temperature polarized single crystal absorption spectrum. The resonance Raman intensities and excitation profiles are calculated with the time dependent theory of spectroscopy and include the interference between the electronic states. The origin of the unusual intensities is quantitatively explained in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the Raman cross sections from the two states.},

  abstract = {To explore the relationship between local electromagnetic field enhancement and the large SERS (surface enhanced Raman scattering) enhancement that enables the observation of single molecule Raman spectra, we measure both resonant Rayleigh scattering spectra and rhodamine 6G Raman spectra from single Ag particles. Our apparatus combines the techniques of dark-field optical microscopy for resonant Rayleigh measurements, and grazing incidence Raman spectroscopy. The Rayleigh spectra show that the citrate-reduced Ag colloid is extremely heterogeneous. Only the larger particles, in part created by salt induced aggregation, show a large SERS effect. In agreement with the work of Nie and Emory, we find that a few nanocrystals show huge single molecule R6G SERS intensities. While all SERS active particles have some resonant Rayleigh scattering at the 514.5 nm laser wavelength, there is no correlation between the resonant Rayleigh spectra and the SERS intensity. We discuss a model in which huge SERS intensities result from single chemisorbed molecules interacting with ballistic electrons in optically excited large Ag particles. This model is a natural consequence of the standard local electromagnetic field model for SERS and the high surface sensitivity of plasmon dephasing in the noble metals.},

The reaction proceeds by stepwise oxidation of RuIIIORuIII to RuVORuV with oxidation of RuIVORuIII the slow step. RuVORuV has been identified as an intermediate by the appearance of its ClO4- salt as a black suspension in concentrated solutions at 5 oC. It is the key intermediate in water oxidation. The mechanism may involve a bimolecular step and formation of a peroxo-bridged intermediate. Catalytic water oxidation is greatly retarded after just a few catalytic cycles because of anation induced by O2 evolution. },

M+ include the following metal ions: Mg+, Al+, Sc+: Ti+, V+, Cr+, Mn+, Fe+, Co+, Ni+, Cu+, and Zn+. In all cases, the primary product corresponds to endothermic loss of the intact pyridine molecule, with minor production of MXe+ formed by ligand exchange. In the Cr+(pyridine) system, an additional minor reaction pathway involving a ring-opening reaction with small neutral molecule loss is also observed. The cross-section thresholds are interpreted to yield 0 and 298 K bond dissociation energies for M+-pyridine after accounting for the effects of multiple ion-molecule collisions, internal energy of the reactant ions, and dissociation lifetimes. Density functional calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory are used to determine the structures of these complexes and provide molecular constants necessary for the thermodynamic analysis of the experimental data. Theoretical bond dissociation energies at this level of theory are unreliable as even the trends in the calculated values do not parallel measured values. Measured M+-pyridine bond dissociation energies compare favorably to the four values previously determined by kinetic method or photodissociation experiments.},

  abstract = {Two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections of four representative series of octupolar molecules are theoretically investigated. The general structure−TPA-property relationship is described by using the effective four-state valence-bond three-charge-transfer model. As the charge-transfer character of the ground electronic state increases due to the strong donors or acceptors, (i) the transition dipole matrix elements between the ground and 2-fold degenerate excited states increase, (ii) the energy gap decreases, and consequently (iii) the TPA transition amplitude monotonically increases. Thus, the design strategy to maximize the TPA cross section of the octupolar molecule is established. On the basis of the four-state model, the first hyperpolarizability of the octupolar molecule is found to be linearly proportional to the TPA cross section. This theoretical relationship is confirmed by using the ab initio calculation results. The Hammett correlation analysis of the TPA cross section and first hyperpolarizability is also presented.},

  abstract = {The chiral molecule (R,R)-tartaric acid adsorbed on nickel surfaces creates highly enantioselective heterogeneous catalysts, but the nature of chiral modification remains unknown. Here, we report on the behavior of this chiral molecule with a defined Ni(110) surface. A combination of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and periodic density functional theory calculations reveals a new mode of chiral induction. At room temperatures and low coverages, (R,R)-tartaric acid is adsorbed in its bitartrate form with two-point bonding to the surface via both carboxylate groups. The molecule is preferentially located above the 4-fold hollow site with each carboxylate functionality adsorbed at the short bridge site via O atoms placed above adjacent Ni atoms. However, repulsive interactions between the chiral OH groups of the molecule and the metal atoms lead to severely strained adsorption on the bulk-truncation Ni(110) surface. As a result, the most stable adsorption structure is one in which this adsorption-induced stress is alleviated by significant relaxation of surface metal atoms so that a long distance of 7.47 \AA between pairs of Ni atoms can be accommodated at the surface. Interestingly, this leads the bonding Ni atoms to describe a chiral footprint at the surface for which all local mirror symmetry planes are destroyed. Calculations show only one chiral footprint to be favored by the (R,R)-tartaric acid, with the mirror adsorption site being unstable by 6 kJ mol-1. This energy difference is sufficient to enable the same local chiral reconstruction and motif to be sustained over 90% of the system, leading to an overall highly chiral metal surface.},

  abstract = {This work presents the first step toward a glucose biosensor using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Historically, glucose has been extremely difficult to detect by SERS because it has a small normal Raman cross section and adsorbs weakly or not at all to bare silver surfaces. In this paper, we report the first systematic study of the direct detection of glucose using SERS. Glucose is partitioned into an alkanethiol monolayer adsorbed on a silver film over nanosphere (AgFON) surface and thereby, it is preconcentrated within the 0−4 nm thick zone of electromagnetic field enhancement. The experiments presented herein utilize leave-one-out partial least-squares (LOO−PLS) analysis to demonstrate quantitative glucose detection both over a large (0−250 mM) and clinically relevant (0−25 mM) concentration range. The root-mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.8 mM (33.1 mg/dL) in the clinical study is near that desired for medical applications (1 mM, 18 mg/dL). Future studies will advance toward true in vivo, real time, minimally invasive sensing.},

Ultrathin films (20-40 nm) containing myoglobin or cytochrome P450cam and DNA grown layer-by-layer on electrodes were activated by hydrogen peroxide, and the enzyme in the film generated metabolite styrene oxide from styrene. This styrene oxide reacted with double stranded (ds)-DNA in the same film, mimicking metabolism and DNA damage in human liver. DNA damage was detected by square wave voltammetry (SWV) by using catalytic oxidation with Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) and by monitoring the binding of Co(bpy)33+. Damaged DNA reacts more rapidly than intact ds-DNA with Ru(bpy)33+, giving SWV peaks at -1 V versus SCE that grow larger with reaction time. Co(bpy)33+ binds more strongly to intact ds-DNA, and its SWV peaks at 0.04 V decreased as DNA was damaged. Little change in SWV signals was found for incubations of DNA/enzyme films with unreactive organic controls or hydrogen peroxide. Capillary electrophoresis and HPLC-MS suggested the formation of styrene oxide adducts of DNA bases under similar reaction conditions in thin films and in solution. The catalytic SWV method was more sensitive than the Co(bpy)33+ binding assay, providing multiple measurements over a 5 min reaction time.},

Asymmetric hydrosilylation of styrene with trichlorosilane in the presence of chiral BINAP--Pd nanoparticles afforded an optically active 1-phenyl-1-trichlorosilylethane which was converted into an optically active 1-phenylethanol (95% enantiomeric excess) by oxidative cleavage of the carbon--silicon bond.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) yields substantial errors for the excitation energies of charge-transfer (CT) excited states, when approximate standard exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are used, for example, SVWN, BLYP, or B3LYP. Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree-Fock or exact Kohn-Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin-bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll-spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.},

  abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an emerging treatment modality for a range of disease classes, both cancerous and noncancerous. This has brought about an active pursuit of new PDT agents that can be optimized for the unique set of photophysical characteristics that are required for a successful clinical agent. We now describe a totally new class of PDT agent, the BF2-chelated 3,5-diaryl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl-3,5-diarylpyrrol-2-ylideneamines (tetraarylazadipyrromethenes). Optimized synthetic procedures have been developed to facilitate the generation of an array of specifically substituted derivatives to demonstrate how control of key therapeutic parameters such as wavelength of maximum absorbance and singlet-oxygen generation can be achieved. Photosensitizer absorption maxima can be varied within the body's therapeutic window between 650 and 700 nm, with high extinction coefficients ranging from 75000 to 85000 M-1 cm-1. Photosensitizer singlet-oxygen generation level was modulated by the exploitation of the heavy-atom effect. An array of photosensitizers with and without bromine atom substituents gave rise to a series of compounds with varying singlet-oxygen generation profiles. X-ray structural evidence indicates that the substitution of the bromine atoms has not caused a planarity distortion of the photosensitizer. Comparative singlet-oxygen production levels of each photosensitizer versus two standards demonstrated a modulating effect on singlet-oxygen generation depending upon substituent patterns about the photosensitizer. Confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging of 18a in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells proved that the photosensitizer was exclusively localized to the cellular cytoplasm. In vitro light-induced toxicity assays in HeLa cervical carcinoma and MRC5-SV40 transformed fibroblast cancer cell lines confirmed that the heavy-atom effect is viable in a live cellular system and that it can be exploited to modulate assay efficacy. Direct comparison of the efficacy of the photosensitizers 18b and 19b, which only differ in molecular structure by the presence of two bromine atoms, illustrated an increase in efficacy of more than a 1000-fold in both cell lines. All photosensitizers have very low to nondeterminable dark toxicity in our assay system.},

@ARTICLE{jacs_126_12636,
  abstract = {The central component of the programmable molecular switch recently demonstrated by Stoddart and Heath is [2]rotaxane, which consists of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) shuttle (CBPQT4+)(PF6-)4 (the ring) encircling a finger and moving between two stations, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and 1,5-dioxynaphthalene (DNP). As a step toward understanding the mechanism of this switch, we report here its electronic structure using two flavors of density functional theory (DFT): B3LYP/6-31G** and PBE/6-31G**. We find that the electronic structure of composite [2]rotaxane can be constructed reasonably well from its parts by combining the states of separate stations (TTF and DNP) with or without the (CBPQT)(PF6)4 shuttle around them. That is, the ``CBPQT$@$TTF'' state, (TTF)(CBPQT)(PF6)4−(DNP), is described well as a combination of the (TTF)(CBPQT)(PF6)4 complex and free DNP, and the ``CBPQT$@$DNP'' state, (TTF)−(DNP)(CBPQT)(PF6)4, is described well as a combination of free TTF and the (DNP)(CBPQT)(PF6)4 complex. This allows an aufbau or a ``bottom-up'' approach to predict the complicated [n]rotaxanes in terms of their components. This should be useful in designing new components to lead to improved properties of the switches. A critical function of the (CBPQT4+)(PF6-)4 shuttle in switching is that it induces a downshift of the frontier orbital energy levels of the station it is on (TTF or DNP). This occurs because of the net positive electrostatic potential exerted by the CBPQT4+ ring, which is located closer to the active station than the four PF6-'s. This downshift alters the relative position of energy levels between TTF and DNP, which in turn alters the electron tunneling rate between them, even when the shuttle is not involved directly in the actual tunneling process. Based on this switching mechanism, the ``CBPQT$@$TTF'' state is expected to be a better conductor since it has better aligned levels between the two stations. A second potential role of the (CBPQT4+)(PF6-)4 shuttle in switching is to provide low-lying LUMO levels. If the shuttle is involved in the actual tunneling process, the reduced HOMO−LUMO gap (from 3.6 eV for the isolated finger to 1.1 eV for ``CBPQT$@$TTF'' or to 0.6 eV for ``CBPQT$@$DNP'' using B3LYP) would significantly facilitate the electron tunneling through the system. This might occur in a folded conformation where a direct contact between free station and the shuttle on the other station is possible. When this becomes the main switching mechanism, we expect the ``CBPQT$@$DNP'' state to become a better conductor because its HOMO−LUMO gap is smaller and because its HOMO and LUMO are localized at different stations (HOMO exclusively at TTF and LUMO at CBPQT encircling DNP) so that the HOMO-to-LUMO tunneling would be through the entire molecule of [2]rotaxane. Thus an essential element in designing these switches is to determine the configuration of the molecules (e.g., through self-assembled monolayers or incorporation of conformation stabilizing units).},

  abstract = {This work reports an explanation for the unusual monoexponential fluorescence decay of 5-fluorotryptophan (5FTrp) in single-Trp mutant proteins [Broos, J.; Maddalena, F.; Hesp, B. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 22−23] and substantially clarifies the origin of the ubiquitous nonexponential fluorescence decay of tryptophan in proteins. Our results strongly suggest that the extent of nonexponential fluorescence decay is governed primarily by the efficiency of electron transfer (ET) quenching by a nearby amide group in the peptide bond. Fluoro substitution increases the ionization potential (IP) of indole, thereby suppressing the ET rate, leading to a longer average lifetime and therefore a more homogeneous decay. We report experimental IPs for a number of substituted indoles including 5-fluoroindole, 5-fluoro-3-methylindole, and 6-fluoroindole, along with accurate ab initio calculations of the IPs for these and 20 related molecules. The results predict the IP of 5-fluorotryptophan to be 0.19 eV higher than that of tryptophan. 5-Fluoro substitution does not measurably alter the excitation-induced change in permanent dipole moment nor does it change the fluorescent state from 1La to 1Lb. In combination with electronic structure information this argues that the increased IP and the decreased excitation energy of the 1La state, together 0.3 eV, are solely responsible for the strong reduction of electron transfer quenching. 6-Fluoro substitution is predicted to increase the IP by a mere 0.09 eV. In agreement with our conclusions, the fluorescence decay curves of 6-fluorotryptophan-containing proteins are well fit using only two decay times compared to three required for Trp.},

  abstract = {A rapid detection protocol suitable for use by first-responders to detect anthrax spores using a low-cost, battery-powered, portable Raman spectrometer has been developed. Bacillus subtilis spores, harmless simulants for Bacillus anthracis, were studied using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) on silver film over nanosphere (AgFON) substrates. Calcium dipicolinate (CaDPA), a biomarker for bacillus spores, was efficiently extracted by sonication in nitric acid and rapidly detected by SERS. AgFON surfaces optimized for 750 nm laser excitation have been fabricated and characterized by UV?vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and SERS. The SERS signal from extracted CaDPA was measured over the spore concentration range of 10-14?10-12 M to determine the saturation binding capacity of the AgFON surface and to calculate the adsorption constant (Kspore = 1.7 ? 1013 M-1). At present, an 11 min procedure is capable of achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of ?2.6 ? 103 spores, below the anthrax infectious dose of 104 spores. The data presented herein also demonstrate that the shelf life of prefabricated AgFON substrates can be as long as 40 days prior to use. Finally, these sensing capabilities have been successfully transitioned from a laboratory spectrometer to a field-portable instrument. Using this technology, 104 bacillus spores were detected with a 5 s data acquisition period on a 1 month old AgFON substrate. The speed and sensitivity of this SERS sensor indicate that this technology can be used as a viable option for the field analysis of potentially harmful environmental samples.},

  abstract = {To study the initial chemical events related to the detonation of triacetonetriperoxide (TATP), we have performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In these simulations we used the ReaxFF reactive force field, which we have extended to reproduce the quantum mechanics (QM)-derived relative energies of the reactants, products, intermediates, and transition states related to the TATP unimolecular decomposition. We find excellent agreement between the QM-predicted reaction products and those observed from 100 independent ReaxFF unimolecular MD cookoff simulations. Furthermore, the primary reaction products and average initiation temperature observed in these 100 independent unimolecular cookoff simulations match closely with those observed from a TATP condensed-phase cookoff simulation, indicating that unimolecular decomposition dominates the thermal initiation of the TATP condensed phase. Our simulations demonstrate that thermal initiation of condensed-phase TATP is entropy-driven (rather than enthalpy-driven), since the initial reaction (which mainly leads to the formation of acetone, O2, and several unstable C3H6O2 isomers) is almost energy-neutral. The O2 generated in the initiation steps is subsequently utilized in exothermic secondary reactions, leading finally to formation of water and a wide range of small hydrocarbons, acids, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, and alcohols.},

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed the mirror image relationship between the d-Pen-capped and the l-Pen-capped gold nanoclusters, suggesting that the surface modifier acts as a chiral selector, and that the nanoclusters have well-defined stereostructures as common chiral molecules do. No CD signals could be obtained when the gold nanoclusters were synthesized by using a racemic mixture (rac-Pen).

Each fractioned component has the mean diameter of 0.57, 1.18, or 1.75 nm that was determined by a solution-phase small-angle X-ray scattering. With a decrease in the mean cluster diameter, optical activity or anisotropy factors gradually increased.

While cofacial oligomers show the greatest bandwidths at a given intermolecular C−C contact distance, for a fixed center-to-center intermolecular distance, tilted $\pi$-stacking increases $\pi$-overlap (particularly for LUMO orbitals) and decreases electrostatic repulsion, yielding optimum tilt angles for packing of 40−60\textdegree at small intermolecular separations. The calculations also reveal that bandwidths and intrinsic mobilities of holes and electrons in conjugated oligoheterocycles can be quite comparable.},

  abstract = {Due to strong electric fields at the surface, the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by noble metal nanoparticles are strongly enhanced. These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR antibody-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time.},

Compound 5 and the previously reported tetrathiafulvalene-calix[4]pyrrole 4 both adopt a 1,3-alternative conformation in the solid state, as determined from X-ray crystallographic analysis. The anion binding properties of the tetrathiafulvalene-calix[4]pyrroles 5 and 6, as well as those of the parent meso-octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (1), were investigated in acetone using 1H NMR spectroscopic and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) techniques and, within the error limits of the methods, were generally found to give concordant results. On the basis of the results of the ITC studies carried out in 1,2-dichloroethane, increasing the number of tetrathiafulvalene units annulated to the calix[4]pyrrole system serves to enhance the anion binding affinities substantially but at the price of lowered selectivity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies, carried out in 1,2-dichloroethane, provided evidence of an anion-dependent electrochemical response with Cl- and Br- ions. This response was particularly dramatic in the case of the monotetrathiafulvalene-calix[4]pyrrole 5, with a Emax of 145 mV being seen after the addition of approximately 1 equiv of Cl- ion.},

The method relies on the conjugation of a glutathione monolayer-protected gold cluster (MPC) with a single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv), mutated to present an exposed cysteine residue. Efficient formation of a gold−thiolate bond between the MPC and scFv depends on activation of the gold cluster by chemical oxidation. Once formed, the MPC−scFv conjugate is treated with a reductant to quench cluster reactivity. The procedure has been performed with an MPC with an average Au71 core and an scFv directed against a tetrameric protein, the influenza neuraminidase. A complex of the MPC−scFv conjugate with the neuraminidase was isolated, and the presence of four gold clusters was verified by cryoelectron microscopy.},

  abstract = {This work presents a detailed analysis of enhanced Raman scattering of the pyridine−Ag20 model system using time-dependent density functional theory. A consistent treatment of both the chemical and electromagnetic enhancements (EM) is achieved by employing a recently developed approach based on a short-time approximation for the Raman cross section. A strong dependence of the absolute and relative intensities on the binding site and excitation wavelength is found. The analysis of the Raman scattering cross sections shows the importance of different contributions to the enhancements, including static chemical enhancements (factor of 10), charge-transfer enhancements (103), and EM enhancements (105). The largest enhancement found (105−106) is due to the EM mechanism, with a small contribution from the chemical interaction. This suggests that the enhanced Raman scattering due to atomic clusters is comparable to findings on single nanoparticles. A combination of information about the vibrational motion and the local chemical environment provides a simple picture of why certain normal modes are enhanced more than others.},

Raman spectra were obtained in resonance with the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands in the near-infrared region and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) bands in the near-UV region. Geometry optimization and frequency calculations using density functional theory (DFT) have been performed for [M(L)2]z and [M(LBu)2]z species (M = Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Cu, Au, z = -1; M = Au, z = 0). On the basis of frequency calculations and normal-mode analysis, we have assigned the most important totally symmetric vibrations as well as corresponding overtone and combination bands that appear in rR spectra of compounds [Ni(L)2]1-, [M(LBu)2]1- (M = Ni, Pt, Co, Cu). Experimental values of dimensionless normal coordinate displacements in excited states have been determined by fitting of rR spectra together with the absorption band shape, based on the time-dependent theory of Heller. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and multireference post-Hartree\^aFock ab initio calculations, using the difference dedicated configuration interaction (MR-DDCI) method, were carried out to evaluate dimensionless normal coordinate displacements quantum chemically. The calculations show encouraging agreement with the experimental values. The large distortions along several normal modes led to significant vibronic broadening of IVCT and LMCT bands, and the broadening was accounted for in the deconvolution of the absorption spectra. The presence of an intense rR band around 1100 cm-1 was found to be a reliable marker for the presence of sulfur-based radicals.},

Bimolecular energy or electron transfer between Ru(bpy)32+* and ferrocenium (Fc+), the oxidized species of Fc, along with suppression of radical reactions is suggested as the mechanism for quenching ECL. Fc shows more efficient quenching of ECL compared with the known quenchers phenol and 1,1-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridine dication (MV2+). The ECL quenching rate constant was 5.6 x 10^10 M-1 s-1. Using Fc as a quencher label on a complementary DNA sequence, an intramolecular ECL quenching in hybridized oligonucleotide strands has been realized. With essentially complete quenching efficiency, this system has the potential for application to sequence-specific DNA detection.},

  abstract = {A new method to stabilize and functionalize surfaces for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is demonstrated. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to deposit a sub-1-nm alumina layer on silver film-over-nanosphere (AgFON) substrates. The resulting overlayer maintains and stabilizes the SERS activity of the underlying silver while presenting the surface chemistry of the alumina overlayer, a commonly used polar adsorbent in chromatographic separations. The relative affinity of analytes for alumina-modified AgFON substrates can be determined by their polarity. On the basis of SERS measurements, dipicolinic acid displays the strongest binding to the ALD alumina-modified AgFON among a set of pyridine derivatives with varying polarity. This strong affinity for carboxylate groups makes the SERS substrate an ideal candidate for bacillus spores detection using the dipicolinate biomarker. The SERS signal from extracted dipicolinate was measured over the spore concentration range 10-14?10-12 M to determine the saturation binding capacity of the alumina-modified AgFON surface. The adsorption constant was determined to be Kspore = 9.0 ? 1013 M-1. A 10-s data collection time is capable of achieving a limit of detection of ?1.4 ? 103 spores. The shelf life of prefabricated substrates is at least 9 months prior to use. In comparison to the bare AgFON substrates, the ALD-modified AgFON substrates demonstrate twice the sensitivity with 6 times shorter data acquisition time and 7 times longer temporal stability. ALD expands the palette of available chemical methods to functionalize SERS substrates, which will enable improved and diverse chemical control over the nature of analyte?surface binding for biomedical, homeland security, and environmental applications.},

In most instances, the oscillatory dependence of the peak shift on wavelength tracks with the wavelength dependence of the real part of the refractive index, as determined by a Kramers-Kronig transformation of the molecular resonance absorption spectrum.

  abstract = {We have prepared gold nanoparticles covered with N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine and N-isobutyryl-d-cysteine, respectively. These particles with a mean particle size smaller than 2 nm are highly soluble in water and are amenable to chiroptical techniques such as vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Density functional theory shows that the VCD spectra are sensitive toward the conformation of the adsorbed thiol. Based on the comparison between the experimental VCD spectrum and the calculated VCD spectra for different conformers, a preferential conformation of the thiol adsorbed on the gold particles can be proposed. In this conformation the carboxylate group interacts with the gold particle in addition to the sulfur. The particles could furthermore be separated according to their charge and size into well-defined compounds. The optical absorption spectra revealed a well-quantized electronic structure and a systematic red-shift of the absorption onset with increasing gold core size, which was manifested in a color change with particle size. Some compounds showed basically identical absorption spectra as analogous gold particles protected with l-glutathione. This shows that these particles have identical core sizes (10\^a12, 15 and 18 gold atoms, respectively) and indicates that the number and arrangement of the adsorbed thiol are the same, independent of the two thiols, which have largely different sizes. Some separated compounds show strong optical activity with opposite sign when covered with the d- and l-enantiomer, respectively, of N-isobutyryl-cysteine. The origin of the optical activity in the metal-based transitions is discussed. The observations are consistent with a mechanism based on a chiral footprint on the metal core imparted by the adsorbed thiol.},

The SERS spectra of adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, and uracil were recorded along with their corresponding nucleosides and 5?-deoxynucleotides. For the cytosine series, all three spectra had similar relative band intensities but the spectra of adenine were different from those of adenosine and dAMP, probably due to differences in orientation on the surface. No enhanced bands from the phosphate or sugar groups were observed. There were general similarities between the SERS spectra of the purine mononucleotides and the pyrimidine mononucleotides, but the spectra were sufficiently different to allow each of them to be distinguished. This method can therefore be used for high sensitivity, label-free identification of mononucleotides.},

  abstract = {We report energy-transferring organically modified silica nanoparticles for two-photon photodynamic therapy. These nanoparticles co-encapsulate two-photon fluorescent dye nanoaggregates as an energy up-converting donor and a photosensitizing PDT drug as an acceptor. They combine two features: (i) aggregation-enhanced two-photon absorption and emission properties of a novel two-photon dye and (ii) nanoscopic fluorescence resonance energy transfer between this nanoaggregate and a photosensitizer, 2-devinyl-2-(1-hexyloxyethyl)pyropheophorbide. Stable aqueous dispersions of the co-encapsulating nanoparticles (diameter $\sim$ 30 nm) have been prepared in the nonpolar interior of micelles by coprecipitating an organically modified silica sol with the photosensitizer and an excess amount of the two-photon dye which forms fluorescent aggregates by phase separation from the particle matrix. Using a multidisciplinary nanophotonic approach, we show: (i) indirect excitation of the photosensitizer through efficient two-photon excited intraparticle energy transfer from the dye aggregates in the intracellular environment of tumor cells and (ii) generation of singlet oxygen and in vitro cytotoxic effect in tumor cells by photosensitization under two-photon irradiation.},

  abstract = {Palladium and platinum are important catalytic metals, and it would be highly advantageous to be able to use surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to study reactive species and intermediates on their surfaces. In this paper we describe the use of templated electrodeposition through colloidal templates to produce thin (<1 m) films of palladium and platinum containing close packed hexagonal arrays of uniform sphere segment voids. We show that, even though these films are not rough, when the appropriate film thickness and sphere diameter are employed these surfaces give stable, reproducible surface enhancements for Raman scattering from molecules adsorbed at the metal surface. We report SERS spectra for benzenethiol adsorbed on the structured palladium and platinum surfaces of different thicknesses and void diameters and show that, for 633 nm radiation, enhancements of 1800 and 550 can be obtained for palladium and platinum, respectively.},

  abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is a key optical property of metallic nanoparticles. The peak position of the LSPR for noble-metal nanoparticles is highly dependent upon the refractive index of the surrounding media and has therefore been used for chemical and biological sensing. In this work, we explore the influence of resonant adsorbates on the LSPR of bare Ag nanoparticles (lambda(max,bare)). Specifically, we study the effect of rhodamine 6G (R6G) adsorption on the nanoparticle plasmon resonance because of its importance in single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SMSERS). Understanding the coupling between the R6G molecular resonances and the nanoparticle plasmon resonances will provide further insights into the role of LSPR and molecular resonance in SMSERS. By tuning lambda(max,bare) through the visible wavelength region, the wavelength-dependent LSPR response of the Ag nanoparticles to R6G binding was monitored. Furthermore, the electronic transitions of R6G on Ag surface were studied by measuring the surface absorption spectrum of R6G on an Ag film. Surprisingly, three LSPR shift maxima are found, whereas the R6G absorption spectrum shows only two absorption features. Deconvolution of the R6G surface absorption spectra at different R6G concentrations indicates that R6G forms dimers on the metal surface. An electromagnetic model based on quasi-static (Gans) theory reveals that the LSPR shift features are associated with the absorption of R6G monomer and dimers. Electronic structure calculations of R6G under various conditions were performed to study the origin of the LSPR shift features. These calculations support the view that the R6G dimer formation is the most plausible cause for the complicated LSPR response. These findings show the extreme sensitivity of LSPR in elucidating the detailed electronic structure of a resonant adsorbate.},

  abstract = {The existence of single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SMSERS) is proven by employing a frequency-domain approach. This is demonstrated using two isotopologues of Rhodamine 6G that offer unique vibrational signatures. When an average of one molecule was adsorbed per silver nanoparticle, only one isotopologue was typically observed under dry N2 environment. Additionally, the distribution of vibrational frequencies hidden under the ensemble average is revealed by examining the single-molecule spectra. Correlation with transmission electron microscopy reveals that SMSERS active aggregates are composed of multiple randomly sized and shaped nanoparticles. At higher coverage and in a humid environment, adsorbate interchange was detected. Using 2D cross correlation, vibrational modes from different isotopologues were anti-correlated, indicating that the dynamic behavior was from multiple molecules competing for a single hot spot. This allows hot-spot diffusion to be directly observed without analyzing the peak intensity fluctuations.},

Whereas, in the absence of a chloride anion, the TNDCF tail of the trinitrodicyanomethylenefluorene-C60 substrate binds to the TTF-calix[4]pyrrole in a 2:1 (substrate/receptor) stoichiometry in CH2Cl2 solution, addition of a chloride anion (yellow) leads the TNDCF tail to be displaced in favor of a bound C60 head, a process that leads to the formation of a complex with overall 1:2:2 substrate/receptor/chloride anion stoichiometry.

  abstract = {The total structure determination of thiol-protected Au clusters has long been a major issue in cluster research. Herein, we report an unusual single crystal structure of a 25-gold-atom cluster (1.27 nm diameter, surface-to-surface distance) protected by eighteen phenylethanethiol ligands. The Au25 cluster features a centered icosahedral Au13 core capped by twelve gold atoms that are situated in six pairs around the three mutually perpendicular 2-fold axes of the icosahedron. The thiolate ligands bind to the Au25 core in an exclusive bridging mode. This highly symmetric structure is distinctly different from recent predictions of density functional theory, and it also violates the empirical golden rule``cluster of clusters'', which would predict a biicosahedral structure via vertex sharing of two icosahedral M13 building blocks as previously established in various 25-atom metal clusters protected by phosphine ligands. These results point to the importance of the ligand−gold core interactions. The Au25(SR)18 clusters exhibit multiple molecular-like absorption bands, and we find the results are in good correspondence with time-dependent density functional theory calculations for the observed structure.},

  abstract = {Hybrid nanostructures of organic dyes and inorganic gold nanorods are constructed using the layer-by-layer assembly method via electrostatic interactions. Strong coupling is observed between the molecular resonance of dyes and the plasmonic resonance of gold nanorods when their spectra overlap strongly. The coupling strength is tuned by choosing gold nanorods with longitudinal plasmon wavelengths varying from 570 to 870 nm. The resonance coupling-induced plasmon shift is found to be strongly dependent on the dye concentration and the spacing between the dye and nanorod. Moreover, the resonance coupling can be switched off by laser illumination to decompose adsorbed dyes. We believe this is the first time that the coupling between molecular and plasmonic resonances is observed for freestanding hybrid nanostructures constructed out of dyes and colloidal gold nanorods. These results will be helpful in understanding the fundamental interactions between molecular and plasmonic resonances and useful for the design of resonance coupling-based chemical and biological sensors.},

This reaction is faster than the well-known core etching. Surprisingly, if a chiral thiol is exchanged for its opposite enantiomer, the optical activity in the metal-based electronic transitions is reversed although the form of the CD spectra remains largely unchanged. The extent of inversion corresponds to the overall ee of the chiral ligand in the system. This shows that the chiral arrangement of metal atoms in the metal particle (surface) can not withstand the driving force imposed by the ligand of opposite absolute configuration. If the incoming thiol has a different structure, the electronic transitions in the metal core are slightly modified whereas the absorption onset remains unchanged. These results emphasize the influence of the thiols on the structure of the gold nanoparticles and give insight on the ligand exchange pathways.},

However, it would be most useful to have quantitative criteria for predicting structures, binding, and excitation energies for use in designing molecules with mechanical bonds. We assess here the use of density functional theory (DFT) to a noncovalently bound complex and find that no density functional is fully satisfactory. However, we find that the new M06-suite of density functionals, which include attractive medium-range interactions, leads to dramatic improvements in the structures (error of 0.04 \r A in the interplanar distances for M06-L compared to 0.42 \r A for B3LYP) and excitation energies (within 0.08 eV for TD-M06-HF without empirical correction compared to 2.2 eV error for TD-B3LYP). However, M06 predicts the complex to be too strongly bound by 22.6 kcal mol−1 (B3LYP leads to too weak a bond by 29 kcal mol−1), while current empirical FF DREIDING is too weakly bound by only 15 kcal mol−1.},

  abstract = {Fabricating well-defined and highly reproducible platforms for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is very important in developing practical SERS sensors. We report a novel SERS platform composed of a single metallic nanowire (NW) on a metallic film. Optical excitation of this novel sandwich nanostructure provides a line of SERS hot spots (a SERS hot line) at the gap between the NW and the film. This single nanowire on a film (SNOF) architecture can be easily fabricated, and the position of hot spots can be conveniently located in situ by using an optical microscope during the SERS measurement. We show that high-quality SERS spectra from benzenethiol, brilliant cresyl blue, and single-stranded DNA can be obtained on a SNOF with reliable reproducibility, good time stability, and excellent sensitivity, and thus, SNOFs can potentially be employed as effective SERS sensors for label-free biomolecule detection. We also report detailed studies of polarization- and material-dependent SERS enhancement of the SNOF structure.},

  abstract = {The surface-enhanced Raman excitation profiles (REPs) of rhodamine 6G (R6G) on Ag surfaces are studied using a tunable optical parametric oscillator excitation source and versatile detection scheme. These experiments afford the ability to finely tune the excitation wavelength near the molecular resonance of R6G (i.e., $\sim$500-575 nm) and perform wavelength-scanned surface-enhanced Raman excitation measurements of a single molecule. The ensemble-averaged surface-enhanced REPs are measured for collections of molecules on Ag island films. The relative contributions of the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic transitions to the surface-enhanced REPs vary with vibrational frequency. These results highlight the role of excitation energy in determining the resonance Raman intensities for R6G on surface-enhancing nanostructures. Single-molecule measurements are obtained from individual molecules of R6G on Ag colloidal aggregates, where single-molecule junctions are located using the isotope-edited approach. Overall, single-molecule surface-enhanced REPs are narrow in comparison to the ensemble-averaged excitation profiles due to a reduction in inhomogeneous broadening. This work describes the first Raman excitation spectroscopy studies of a single molecule, revealing new information previously obscured by the ensemble.},

This example adds another demonstration of single-molecule sensitivity in SERS through isotopic editing, which in this case is done not by artificial isotopic editing but rather by nature itself. It also highlights SERS as a unique spectroscopic tool that is capable of detecting an isotopic change in one atom of a single molecule.},

  abstract = {Vertical electronic excitations in model systems representing single- and double-stranded B-DNA are characterized using electronic structure theory, including both time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and correlated wave function techniques. Previous TD-DFT predictions of charge-transfer (CT) states well below the optically bright 1$\pi$$\pi$* states are shown to be artifacts of the improper long-range behavior of standard density-functional exchange approximations, which we rectify here using a long-range correction (LRC) procedure. For nucleobase dimers (hydrogen-bonded or $\pi$-stacked), TD-LRC-DFT affords vertical excitation energies in reasonable agreement with the wave function methods, not only for the 1n$\pi$* and 1$\pi$$\pi$* states but also for the CT states, and qualitatively reproduces well-known base-stacking effects on the absorption spectrum of DNA. The emergence of 1$\pi$$\pi$* Frenkel exciton states, localized on a single strand, is clearly evident, and these states (rather than low-energy CT states) are primarily responsible for the fact that DNA's absorption spectrum exhibits a red tail that is absent in monomer absorption spectra. For B-DNA in aqueous solution, the low-energy tail of the CT band (representing both intra- and interstrand CT states) appears at energies comparable to those of the optically bright 1$\pi$$\pi$* exciton states. In systems with more than one base pair, we also observe the emergence of delocalized, interstrand CT excitations, whose excitation energies may be significantly lower than the lowest CT excitation in a single base pair. Together, these observations suggest that a single Watson−Crick base pair is an inadequate model of the photophysics of B-DNA.},

  abstract = {The enhancement mechanism due to the molecule-surface chemical coupling in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been characterized using time-dependent density functional theory. This has been achieved with a systematical study of the chemical enhancement of meta- and para-substituted pyridines interacting with a small silver cluster (Ag$_{20}$). Changing the functional groups on pyridine enabled us to modulate the direct chemical interactions between the pyridine ring and the metal cluster. Surprisingly, we find that the enhancement does not increase as more charge is transferred from the pyridine ring to the cluster. Instead, we find that the magnitude of chemical enhancement is governed to a large extent by the energy difference between the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) of the metal and the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO) of the molecule. The enhancement scales roughly as $(\omega_X/\overline{\omega}_e)^4$, where $\overline{\omega}_e$ is an average excitation energy between the HOMO of the metal and the LUMO of the molecule and $\omega_X$ the HOMO--LUMO gap of the free molecule. The trend was verified by considering substituted benzenethiols, small molecules, and silver clusters of varying sizes. The results imply that molecules that show significant stabilization of the HOMO--LUMO gaps (such as those that readily accept $\pi$-backbonding) would be likely to have strong chemical enhancement. The findings presented here provide the framework for designing new molecules which exhibit high chemical enhancements. However, it remains a challenge to accurately describe the magnitude of the Raman enhancements using electronic structure methods, especially density functional theory, since they often underestimate the energy gap.},

  abstract = {Raman scattering of molecules adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles was investigated. We find strong enhancement of Raman scattering in hybrid composites that exhibit charge transfer absorption with TiO2 nanoparticles. An enhancement factor up to 103 was observed in the solutions containing TiO2 nanoparticles and biomolecules, including the important class of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and dopac (3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid). Only selected vibrations are enhanced, indicating molecular specificity due to distinct binding and orientation of the biomolecules coupled to the TiO2 surface. All enhanced modes are associated with the asymmetric vibrations of attached molecules that lower the symmetry of the charge transfer complex. The intensity and the energy of selected vibrations are dependent on the size and shape of nanoparticle support. Moreover, we show that localization of the charge in quantized nanoparticles (2 nm), demonstrated as the blue shift of particle absorption, diminishes SERS enhancement. Importantly, the smallest concentration of adsorbed molecules shows the largest Raman enhancements suggesting the possibility for high sensitivity of this system in the detection of biomolecules that form a charge transfer complex with metal oxide nanoparticles. The wavelength-dependent properties of a hybrid composite suggest a Raman resonant state. Adsorbed molecules that do not show a charge transfer complex show weak enhancements probably due to the dielectric cavity effect.},

  abstract = {Highly controlled morphology Au nanoparticle films can be formed on the surfaces of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by vapor deposition at cryogenic temperatures (10 K) with intervening condensed Xe layers on the SAMs serving as a buffer to reduce the kinetic energy of the Au atoms impinging on the surface (buffer layer assisted growth or BLAG). Under these conditions pristine Au nanoparticles (AuNp) of a uniform shape and size were deposited onto two SAMs differing only by their terminal groups, 4-benzenedithiol (BDT) and 4-methylbenzenethiol (MBT), to form S/Au and CH3/Au interfaces with essentially identical AuNp overlayer morphologies. A surface enhanced Raman (SERS) enhancement factor ratio EFBDT/EFMBT of 130 was observed uniformly across the surfaces (<10% variation). Since equal electromagnetic contributions to the SERS enhancements are expected from the two identically structured Au overlayer films, the observed SERS intensity ratio accordingly reflects a pure chemical enhancement (CE) contribution arising from the S/Au relative to the CH3/Au interface and thereby provides the first quantitative experimental data for the magnitude of the SERS CE for well-defined Au-molecule contacts.},

Over the range of TiO2 coating thicknesses examined (2 to 8 nm) there is clear enhancement of the dye extinction when plasmonic particles are present, with the enhancement increasing as the TiO2 thickness decreases. The optical enhancements translate into photocurrent enhancements, with the best cells (thinnest TiO2 coatings) showing 9-fold current enhancements under optimal monochromatic illumination. Preliminary experiments indicate that substantially larger optical enhancements are achievable with even thinner dye/particle separation layers, suggesting that even greater photocurrent enhancements may be achievable.},

To this end, bianalyte SERS is performed at 633 nm excitation using the nonresonant molecule 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)-ethylene (BPE) in combination with a benzotriazole derivative as a partner. The results are then extended to the even more challenging case of a small nonresonant molecule, adenine, using an isotopically substituted adenine as bianalyte SERS partners. In addition, SERS cross sections of single-molecule events are quantified, thus providing estimates of the enhancement factors needed to see them. It turns out that an enhancement factor on the order of 109 was sufficient for single-molecule detection of BPE, while maximum enhancement factors of 1010 were observed in extreme cases. In the case of adenine, single-molecule detection was only possible in the rare cases with enhancement factors of 1011. This study constitutes a quantitative fundamental test into the lowest detection limits (in terms of differential cross sections) for single-molecule SERS.},

The crystalline assembly of nanoparticles functionalized with technologically relevant ligands offers the opportunity to obtain unambiguous structural information that can be combined with theoretical calculations based on the known geometry and used to interpret spectroscopic and other information. A series of Ti/O clusters up to 2.0 nm in diameter have been synthesized and functionalized with the adsorbents catechol and isonicotinic acid. Whereas the isonicotinate is always adsorbed in a bridging monodentate mode, four different adsorption modes of catechol have been identified. The particles show a significantly larger variation of the Ti--O distances than observed in the known TiO2 phases and exhibit both sevenfold overcoordination and five- and fourfold undercoordination of the Ti atoms. Theoretical calculations show only a moderate dependence of the catecholate net charge on the geometry of adsorption. All of the catechol-functionalized clusters have a deep-red color due to penetration of the highest occupied catechol levels into the band gap of the Ti/O particles. Spectroscopic measurements of the band gap of the Ti17 cluster are in good agreement with the theoretical values and show a blue shift of 0.22 eV relative to those reported for anatase nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {The effects of various factors on the resonance coupling between elongated Au nanocrystals and organic dyes have been systematically investigated through the preparation of hybrid nanostructures between Au nanocrystals and the electrostatically adsorbed dye molecules. A nanocrystal sample is chosen for each dye to match the longitudinal plasmon resonance wavelength with the absorption peak wavelength of the dye as close as possible so that the resonance coupling strength can be maximized. The resonance coupling strength is found to approximately increase as the molecular volume-normalized absorptivity is increased. It is mainly determined by the plasmon resonance energy of the Au nanocrystals instead of their shapes and sizes. Moreover, the resonance coupling can be reversibly controlled if the dye in the hybrid nanostructures is pH-sensitive. The coupling can also be weakened in the presence of metal ions. These results will be highly useful for designing resonance coupling-based sensing devices and for plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {An active molecular plasmonics system is demonstrated where a supramolecular chromophore generated in a host--guest binding event couples with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) arising from gold nanodisc gratings. This coupling was achieved by wavelength-matching the chromophore and the LSPR with the laser excitation, thus giving rise to surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS). The chromophore is a broad charge-transfer (CT) band centered at 865 nm ( = 3500 M-1 cm-1) generated by the complexation of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT4+) and the guest molecule tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). The substrates consist of sub-1-um gold nanodisc arrays which display dimension-tunable plasmon wavelengths (600000 nm). The vibrational spectra of the complex arising from SERRS (exc = 785 nm) were generated by irradiating an array (LSPR = 765 nm) through the solution to give a chromophore-specific signature with the intensities surface enhanced by 105. Surface adsorption of the empty and complexed CBPQT4+ is also implicated in bringing the chromophore into the electric field arising from the surface-localized plasmon. In a titration experiment, the SERRS effect was then used to verify the role of resonance in turning on the spectrum and to accurately quantify the binding between surface-adsorbed CBPQT4+ and TTF. The use of a nonpatterned gold substrate as well as a color mismatched complex did not show the enhancement, thus validating that spectral overlap between the chromophore and plasmon resonance is key for resonance surface enhancement. Simulations of the electric fields of the arrays are consistent with interdisc plasmon coupling and the observed enhancement factors. The creation of a responsive plasmonic device upon the addition of the guest molecule and the subsequent coupling of the CT chromophore to the plasmon presents favorable opportunities for applications in molecular sensing and active molecular plasmonics.},

We develop an approach to detect noncovalent interactions in real space, based on the electron density and its derivatives. Our approach reveals the underlying chemistry that compliments the covalent structure. It provides a rich representation of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and steric repulsion in small molecules, molecular complexes, and solids. Most importantly, the method, requiring only knowledge of the atomic coordinates, is efficient and applicable to large systems, such as proteins or DNA. Across these applications, a view of nonbonded interactions emerges as continuous surfaces rather than close contacts between atom pairs, offering rich insight into the design of new and improved ligands.},

  abstract = {The superatom model for nanoparticle structure is shown to be inadequate for the prediction of the thermodynamic stability of gold nanoparticles. The observed large HOMO\^aLUMO gaps for stable nanoparticles predicted by this model are, for sulfur-stabilized gold nanoparticles, attributed to covalent interactions of the metal with thiyl adsorbate radicals rather than ionic interactions with thiolate adsorbate ions, as is commonly presumed. In particular, gold adatoms in the stabilizing layer are shown to be of Au(0) nature, subtle but significantly different from the atoms of the gold core owing to the variations in the proportion of gold\^agold and gold\^asulfur links that form. These interactions explain the success of the superatom model in describing the electronic structure of both known and informatory nanoparticle compositions. Nanoparticle reaction energies are, however, found not to correlate with the completion of superatom shells. Instead, local structural effects are found to dominate the chemistry and in particular the significanctly different chemical properties of gold nanoparticle and bulk surfaces. These conclusions are drawn from density-functional-theory calculations for the Au102(p-mercaptobenzoic acid)44 nanoparticle based on the X-ray structure ( Jadzinsky, P. D. ; et al. Science 2007, 318, 430 ), as well calculations for the related Au102(S\^a\textcent\^aCH3)44 nanoparticle, for the inner gold-cluster cores, for partially and overly reacted cores, and for Au(111) surface adsorbates.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SMSERS) of crystal violet (CV) has been reported since 1997, yet others have offered alternative explanations that do not necessarily imply SMSERS. Recently, the isotopologue approach, a statistically significant method to establish SMSERS, has been implemented for members of the rhodamine dye family. We provide the first demonstration of SMSERS of a triphenylmethane dye using the isotopologue approach. Two isotopologues of CV are employed to create chemically identical yet vibrationally distinct probe molecules. Experimental spectra were compared extensively with computational simulations to assign changes in mode frequencies upon deuteration. More than 90 silver nanoparticle clusters dosed with a 50:50 mixture of CV isotopologues were spectroscopically characterized, and the vibrational signature of only deuterated or undeuterated CV was observed 79 times, demonstrating that the isotopologue approach for proving SMSERS is applicable to both the CV and the rhodamine systems. The use of CV, a minimally fluorescent dye, allowed direct evaluation of enhancement factors (EF), which are reported herein. Through experiment and theory, we show that molecular electronic resonance Raman (RR) and surface-enhanced Raman effects combine synergistically in SMSERS. Excluding RR effects, the EFSERS is \^a\textonequarter109. Variations and relationships between substrate morphology and optical properties are further characterized by correlated SMSERS-localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies. We did not observe SMSERS from individual nanoparticles; further, SMSERS-supporting dimers are heterodimers of two disparately sized particles, with no subnanometer gaps. We present the largest collection to date of HRTEM images of SMSERS-supporting nanoparticle assemblies.},

  abstract = {Palladium monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs) coated with octylamines (C8NH2), hexanethiolates (C6S), and mixed monolayers of C8NH2 and C6S exhibit significantly different reactivities with hydrogen gas, depending on the relative amounts of the two ligands coating the Pd nanoparticle surface, as determined by UVvis spectroscopy of Pd MPCs in solution and electronic measurements of films of Pd MPCs as a function of exposure time to hydrogen. The average estimated composition of the 3.0 nm diameter Pd MPCs was Pd919(C6S)192 or Pd919(C8NH2)177x(C6S)x, where x was varied to be 0, 3, 10, 16, 32, or 81 by the synthesis of pure C8NH2 Pd MPCs and subsequent liquid-phase place exchange with a varied amount of C6SH. When x = 010, the Pd MPCs react strongly with H2, leading to aggregated particles in solution and large irreversible changes in the morphology of films accompanied by an increase in film conductivity by 25 orders of magnitude. Pd919(C6S)192 MPCs are stable against significant aggregation in solution and do not exhibit large film morphology changes, but they are also not highly reactive to H2, as determined by minimal changes in the optical properties of solutions and the small, irreversible changes in the conductivity of films in the presence of H2. Finally, when x is 32 and 81, the Pd MPCs are fairly stable, exhibit minimal aggregation or morphology changes, and readily react with H2 based on the significant, reversible changes in film conductivity in the presence of H2. Pd MPCs with mixed monolayers have the benefit of high H2 reactivity while maintaining the structural stability necessary for sensing and catalysis applications.},

Light trapping is particularly critical in such thin-film crystalline silicon solar cells in order to increase light absorption and hence cell efficiency. In this article we investigate the suitability of localized surface plasmons on silver nanoparticles for enhancing the absorbance of silicon solar cells. We find that surface plasmons can increase the spectral response of thin-film cells over almost the entire solar spectrum. At wavelengths close to the band gap of Si we observe a significant enhancement of the absorption for both thin-film and wafer-based structures. We report a sevenfold enhancement for wafer-based cells at l = 1200 nm and up to 16-fold enhancement at l = 1050 nm for 1.25 um thin silicon-on-insulator (SOI) cells, and compare the results with a theoretical dipole-waveguide model. We also report a close to 12-fold enhancement in the electroluminescence from ultrathin SOI light-emitting diodes and investigate the effect of varying the particle size on that enhancement.},

  abstract = {The catalase reaction has been studied in detail by using myoglobin (Mb) mutants. Compound I of Mb mutants (Mb-I), a ferryl species (Fe(IV)=O) paired with a porphyrin radical cation, is readily prepared by the reaction with a nearly stoichiometric amount of m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Upon the addition of H2O2 to an Mb-I solution, Mb-I is reduced back to the ferric state without forming any intermediates. This indicates that Mb-I is capable of performing two-electron oxidation of H2O2 (catalatic reaction). Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the evolved O2 from a 50:50 mixture of H218O2/H216O2 solution containing H64D or F43H/H64L Mb showed the formation of 18O2 (m/e = 36) and 16O2 (m/e = 32) but not 16O18O (m/e = 34). This implies that O2 is formed by two-electron oxidation of H2O2 without breaking the O-O bond. Deuterium isotope effects on the catalatic reactions of Mb mutants and catalase suggest that the catalatic reactions of Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase and F43H/H64L Mb proceed via an ionic mechanism with a small isotope effect of less than 4.0, since the distal histidine residue is located at a proper position to act as a general acid-base catalyst for the ionic reaction. In contrast, other Mb mutants such as H64X (X is Ala, Ser, and Asp) and L29H/H64L Mb oxidize H2O2 via a radical mechanism in which a hydrogen atom is abstracted by Mb-I with a large isotope effect in a range of 10-29, due to a lack of the general acid-base catalyst.},

The details of the method and a range of test calculations, including comparisons with ab initio and experimental results, are given. It is found that in many cases satisfactory results are obtained. However, there are limitations to this type of approach, some of which arise from the AM1 or MNDO methods themselves and others from the present QM/MM implementation. This suggests that it is important to test the applicability of the method to each particular case prior to its use. Possible areas of improvement in the methodology are discussed.},

  abstract = {The fast multipole method proposed by Greengard and Rokhlin (GR) is applied to large biomacromolecular systems. In this method, the system is divided into a hierarchy of cells, and electric field exerted on a particle is decomposed into two parts. The first part is a rapidly varying field due to nearby cells, so that it needs rigorous pairwise calculations. The second part is a slowly varying local field due to distant cells; hence, it allows rapid calculations through a multipole expansion technique. In this work, two additional possibilities for improving the performance are numerically examined. The first is an improvement of the convergence of the expansion by increasing the number of nearby cells, without including higher-order multipole moments. The second is an acceleration of the calculations by the particle–particle and particle–mesh/multipole expansion (PPPM/MPE) method, which uses fast Fourier transform instead of the hierarchy. For this purpose, the PPPM/MPE method originally developed by the authors for a periodic system is extended to a nonperiodic isolated system. The advantages and disadvantages of the GR and PPPM/MPE methods are discussed for both periodic and isolated systems. It is numerically shown that these methods with reasonable costs can reduce the error in potential felt by each particle to 0.1–1 kcal/mol, much smaller than the 30-kcal/mol error involved in conventional simple truncations.},

  abstract = {On the basis of Kohn-Sham density functional (DFT) investigations on elementary organic and organometallic reactions, we show how a detailed understanding of the electronic structure of a reaction system can help recognize certain characteristics of the process, yielding valuable mechanistic concepts. The concept of the base as a selective catalyst in E2 eliminations, for example, leads to a straightforward explanation for the general preference for anti over syn stereochemistry in base-induced elimination reactions. Furthermore, electronic structure considerations provide the so-called E2-S(N)2 mechanistic spectrum, in terms of which one can interpret and understand the competition between elimination and substitution reactions and the shift, on solvation, of the reactivity from E2 to S(N)2. in addition, mechanistic concepts from organometallic and organic chemistry are Linked as we argue that oxidative addition may be conceived, in some respect, as the organometallic analog of the frontside S(N)2 substitution. Finally, we introduce the ideas of ``activation strain{''} of and ``transition state interaction{''} between the deformed reactants in the activated complex, which together determine the activation energy Delta E{*} = Delta E-strain{*} + Delta E-int{*}. They prove to be helpful conceptual tools for understanding in detail how activation barriers and relative efficiencies of competing reaction mechanisms arise and how they may be affected (e.g., by changing reactants or by solvation).},

We are aiming at harmonic force fields, and infrared as well as Raman intensities within the double harmonic approximation, because consideration of hi-her order terms is only feasible for small molecules. In particular, density functional methods have evolved to a powerful quantum chemical tool for the determination of the electronic structure of molecules in the last decade. Underlying theoretical concepts for the calculation of intensities are reviewed, emphasizing necessary approximations and formal aspects of the introduced quantities, which are often not explicated in detail in elementary treatments of this topic. It is shown how complex quantum chemistry program packages can be interfaced to new programs in order to calculate IR and Raman spectra. The advantages of numerical differentiation of analytical gradients, dipole moments, and static, as well as dynamic polarizabilities, are pointed out. We carefully investigate the influence of the basis set size on polarizabilities and their spatial derivatives. This leads us to the construction of a hybrid basis set, which is equally well suited for the calculation of vibrational frequencies and Raman intensities. The efficiency is demonstrated for the highly symmetric C-60, for which we present the first all-electron density functional calculation of its Raman spectrum.},

Compared to conventional element-by-element sparse matrix multiplication schemes, efficiency is gained by the use of the highly optimized basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS). However, some sparsity is lost in the multiatom blocking scheme because these matrix blocks will in general contain negligible elements. As a result, an optimal block size that minimizes the CPU time by balancing these two effects is recovered. In calculations on linear alkanes, polyglycines, estane polymers, and water clusters the optimal block size is found to be between 40 and 100 basis functions, where about 55-75% of the machine peak performance was achieved on an IBM RS6000 workstation. In these calculations, the blocked sparse matrix multiplications can be 10 times faster than a standard element-by-element sparse matrix package.},

The VDD method does not explicitly use the basis functions but calculates the amount of electronic density that flows to or from a certain atom due to bond formation by spatial integration of the deformation density over the atomic Voronoi cell. We compare our method to the well-known Mulliken, Hirshfeld, Bader, and Weinhold [Natural Population Analysis (NPA)] charges for a variety of biological, organic, and inorganic molecules. The Mulliken charges are (again) shown to be useless due to heavy basis set dependency, and the Bader charges (and often also the NPA charges) are not realistic, yielding too extreme values that suggest much ionic character even in the case of covalent bonds. The Hirshfeld and VDD charges, which prove to be numerically very similar, are to be recommended because they yield chemically meaningful charges. We stress the need to use spatial integration over an atomic domain to get rid of basis set dependency, and the need to integrate the deformation density in order to obtain a realistic picture of the charge rearrangement upon bonding. An asset of the VDD charges is the transparency of the approach owing to the simple geometric partitioning of space. The deformation density based charges prove to conform to chemical experience.},

  abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The double counting of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene \textperiodcentered H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies.},

  abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 \textperiodcentered R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 \textperiodcentered R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.},

When small subsystems of large molecules such as active centers of enzymes are studied, quantum chemical calculations based on quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) coupling schemes are a valuable means to interpret the spectra. The goal of this work is a methodological pilot study on how to selectively and thus efficiently extract certain vibrational information for extended molecular systems described by QM/MM methods. This is achieved by an extension of the mode tracking algorithm and a comparison with the partial Hessian diagonalization approach. After validating the methodology for the CO stretching vibration of 2-butanone and a delocalized CO stretch in acetylacetone, the stretching and bending modes of the CO ligand in CO myoglobin are tracked. Such systems represent an ideal application for mode tracking, because only a few strongly localized vibrations are sought for, while the large remainder of the molecule is of interest only as far as it affects these local vibrations. This influence is treated exactly by mode tracking.},

  abstract = {DFT calculations were carried out to study heme complexes with diatomic ligand (CO, NO, or O2) and trans-imidazole ligand. The optimized electronic ground states of CO, NO, and O2 adducts are singlet, doublet, and open-shell singlet, respectively. For O2 adduct, the open-shell singlet is slightly lower in energy than the close-shell singlet. However, important differences are found in optimized structures and vibrational frequencies. Particularly, the trans-imidazole-induced frequency up-shift of the Fe-O(O) stretching mode can be predicted only with the open-shell singlet as ground state. An analysis of normal modes confirms that the up-shifts in the bent (NO and O2) adducts are mainly due to mixing of Fe-X(O) stretching mode with Fe-X-O bending coordinate. Our study of binding mechanism indicates that a secondary source of the upshifts is the diminished weakening of the Fe-X(O) bonds. The Fe-X(O) bond strengths are modulated by sigma competition mechanism, which weakens the Fe-X(O) bond and sigma-pi cooperation mechanism, which only exists in the bent adducts and enforce the Fe-X(O) bond.},

  abstract = {Abstract We accelerated an ab initio molecular QMC calculation by using GPGPU. Only the bottle-neck part of the calculation is replaced by CUDA subroutine and performed on GPU. The performance on a (single core CPU + GPU) is compared with that on a (single core CPU with double precision), getting 23.6 (11.0) times faster calculations in single (double) precision treatments on GPU. The energy deviation caused by the single precision treatment was found to be within the accuracy required in the calculation, ∼10−5 hartree. The accelerated computational nodes mounting GPU are combined to form a hybrid MPI cluster on which we confirmed the performance linearly scales to the number of nodes. \textcopyright 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We argue that this is an outdated philosophy of science that does not accurately describe the practice of chemistry today. Chemists obtain evidence to confirm their theories, not merely to refute them, and have accumulated an impressive body of mechanistic knowledge over the decades. Progress has accelerated in recent years because of technological advances that allow reaction intermediates to be observed directly. Yet textbooks continue to teach that mechanisms can only be proven false. Not only does this approach fail to reflect current practice, it also limits the possibilities for new generations of chemists by denying the value of supporting evidence. Students should be open to the option of designing experiments to confirm a mechanistic proposal and not be constrained by a theoretical approach that maintains that only falsifying experiments have value. Chemists should be free to use evidence to either support or disprove mechanistic hypotheses. Mechanisms can be proven on a practical basis to the same extent as other scientific theories can be.},

  abstract = {The weak bands of formaldehyde extending from $\lambda$3500 A to $\lambda$2300 A are normally assigned to a 1A2\textleftarrow1A1, n\textrightarrow$\pi$ transition (C2$\nu$ symmetry) which is forbidden by electronic selection rules. The present paper gives a quantitative theoretical discussion of the total intensity of these bands in each of the three directions of polarization. Using approximate wave functions for the various electronic states involved, the theory shows that the intensity of the perpendicular bands can be accounted for by vibrationally‐induced mixing of excited electronic states. The calculated total intensity due to this mechanism is f=3\texttimes10-4. It is predicted that most of this intensity is produced by the out‐of‐plane bending vibration and is consequently polarized perpendicular to the C=O axis and in the molecular plane (B1 polarized). The contribution due to in‐plane vibrations (CH2 wagging and antisymmetric C-H stretch), which would be polarized perpendicular to the molecular plane (B2 polarized), is predicted to be much weaker. This is in agreement with experiment. The weak parallel bands that have been observed cannot be interpreted in terms of vibrational‐electronic interaction. It is suggested that these derive their intensity by borrowing, induced by rotation around the C=O axis, from the strong 1A1\textleftarrow1A1, $\pi$\textrightarrow$\pi$ transition. A quantitative theory of this effect gives f∼10-6 for the total oscillator strength of the parallel bands. Several predictions which might be tested experimentally are made on the basis of this hypothesis.},

This suggests a direct link between certain vibronic spectroscopic observations and Raman intensities. The development is carried to the first order in nuclear displacements only-the higher terms give rise to Raman intensities of combinations and overtones. An equation for the polarizability components is obtained which leads directly to the Raman selection rules and in addition provides interesting predictions concerning the Raman and the resonance Raman effect in relation to excited electronic states. Rules are worked out governing the participation of excited electronic states in the Raman effect and these are employed to demonstrate a separabilit$\sim$ of rr and 7r contributions to the scattering of totally symmetric modes. The polarizability expression obtamed here is compared with that of the semiclassical theory of Shorygin and an interesting resemblance is found.

  abstract = {Raman intensity theory is investigated with the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion theory as a basis. The sum over excited states is transformed into an infinite series in ground‐state matrix elements involving an average energy. Particular choice of this average energy and neglect of all terms N  ≥  2 amount to the same approximations as in a variation-perturbation approach used by others. This truncated series, after a transformation through a quantum mechanical identity, assumes a particularly simple form. Calculations using this simple expression are presented for both the H2+ ion and the H2 molecule for several approximate wavefunctions. In several additional calculations for the H2 molecule, a more drastic approximation is employed where it is assumed that the major contribution to the derived polarizability is from the normalization factor of the wavefunction rather than from the detail of the wavefunction itself. The results of these calculations are compared with other calculations and, in the case of H2, also with experimental data. The qualitative success is encouraging. Finally, tentative explanations, based on the present approximation, are offered for some common empirical rules in Raman spectroscopy. These concern (1) the additivity properties for various bond types, (2) the fact that highly ionic bonds tend to exhibit weak Raman intensity while covalent bonds exhibit strong intensity, and (3) that totally symmetric vibrations almost always exhibit significantly greater intensity than do nontotally symmetric vibrations.},

  abstract = {The decay time of the luminescence of a molecule S in front of a metal mirror depends markedly on its distance from the mirror. This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by considering the radiation field of this dipole, given by Hertz classical equation. This field arrives at the molecule, after being reflected at the mirror, with a retardation of the order of 10-15 sec. The decay time of the luminescence depends on the phase shift produced by this retardation, and thus on the ratio of the distance of the oscillator from the mirror, and the wavelength of the emitted light. By measuring the distance dependence of the decay time of the luminescence this retardation effect can be studied. In quantum-mechanical terms the phenomenon can be described as being due to a stimulation or inhibition of the emission of the light quantum. In contrast to the known cases of stimulated emission, the stimulating field is the radiation field of the emitter quantum itself. The energy transfer from an excited molecule S to an acceptor A can be treated in a similar manner by considering the phenomenon as a retardation effect. In classical terms the field of S induces A to oscillate, and the induced field of A arriving at S slows down this oscillator. Simple equations are given for the energy transfer from an excited dipole or quadrupole, and for a row of many dipoles, oscillating in phase, to a weakly absorbing acceptor layer. The latter case is considered as a model for a J-aggregating dye and by comparison with experimental data conclusions concerning the size of a J-aggregate are drawn.},

Diagrammatic perturbation theory is used to obtain explicit quantum‐mechanical expressions for the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ tensors. Selection rules for the symmetric $\gamma$ tensor and for the nonsymmetric $\beta$ and $\gamma$ tensors are then calculated for the important molecular point groups.

  abstract = {We consider the effect of molecular symmetry on the two‐photon absorption constants of a randomly oriented sample of molecules. It is shown that a complete polarization study of an allowed two‐photon transition of a fluid generally yields enough information to permit an unequivocal identification of the symmetry species of the excited state. Ambiguities occur in only a few cases. Thus, oriented molecule studies for symmetry assignment will be largely unnecessary in two‐photon molecular spectroscopy. Symmetry assignment rules are given for all of the 32 crystallographic point groups and for the two groups of linear molecules. It is shown that certain transitions, which are allowed for two photons of different energies, are forbidden for two photons of the same energy. The application of this formalism to Raman scattering problems is discussed.},

When theory is simplified to correspond to the PNA example, two obvious sources of Raman intensity are apparent. One is based on a possible shift of equilibrium nuclear position along the 1334‐cm-1 mode upon exciting PNA into its first excited singlet state (in the near ultraviolet). The other source deals with vibronic coupling of the first excited electronic state with a whole family of states in the deep ultraviolet having similar polarizations. It is seen how this second mechanism appears to be the dominant one in this case. The absolute scattering cross section for the 1334 cm-1 is given and is found to agree with the order of magnitude estimates calculated theoretically.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new approach to semiclassical dynamics which exploits the fact that extended wavefunctions for heavy particles (or particles in harmonic potentials) may be decomposed into time−dependent wave packets, which spread minimally and which execute classical or nearly classical trajectories. A Gaussian form for the wave packets is assumed and equations of motion are derived for the parameters characterizing the Gaussians. If the potential (which may be nonseparable in many coordinates) is expanded in a Taylor series about the instantaneous center of the (many−particle) wave packet, and up to quadratic terms are kept, we find the classical parameters of the wave packet (positions, momenta) obey Hamilton's equation of motion. Quantum parameters (wave packet spread, phase factor, correlation terms, etc.) obey similar first order quantum equations. The center of the wave packet is shown to acquire a phase equal to the action integral along the classical path. State−specific quantum information is obtained from the wave packet trajectories by use of the superposition principle and projection techniques. Successful numerical application is made to the collinear He + H2 system widely used as a test case. Classically forbidden transitions are accounted for and obtained in the same manner as the classically allowed transitions; turning points present no difficulties and flux is very nearly conserved.},

The lifetime of a dipole emitter in the presence of a mirror is determined through a calculation of the complex Poynting vector in the dielectric surrounding the dipole. This method has the advantage over previous approaches to this problem in that the radiative and nonradiative components of the lifetime expression may be rigorously separated. The influence on emitter lifetime of a mirror of finite thickness is also described. A simple expression is derived describing the energy transfer rate in these layered systems. It is shown that nonradiative energy transfer results from coupling of the near field of the dipole to the surface plasmon modes in the metallic absorber.

Both the quantum yield and the radiative lifetime of the luminescent state of the Eu+3 ion are determined by theoretical fits to the data. Whereas the quantum yield spans a range of 0.69-0.86, the radiative lifetime of the electric dipole transition at 612 nm is nearly constant, as required, with a value of 803+-29 microsec. Both the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment and the consistency among the eight experimental systems in predicting the radiative lifetime provide a clear demonstration of the utility of the fatty acid monlayer assembly technique as a method of measurement of emission properties of lunimescent systems and of dielectric properties of surfaces.},

The bulk of the intensity is predicted to be polarized in the plane and perpendicular to the CO bond as observed, and the calculated dipole strength of 2.1\texttimes10−3 a.u. compares well with the measured 2.3\texttimes10−3. This intensity is due to the electron distributions following the nuclear vibrations and is partly cancelled by the intensity which arises from the vibrations of the nuclei themselves. If fixed basis functions are used, intensity arises only from the vibrations of the nuclei. Most of the intensity due to the vibrating electron clouds is found to come from interactions with the overlap distributions of the CH bonds.

  abstract = {A general theoretical framework for introducing many‐body or lattice effects into gas/solid scattering is presented. The theory is presently restricted to classical scattering off harmonic lattices but is otherwise completely general. It is nonperturbative and valid for arbitrary lattice temperature. The theory is based on a formulation of lattice dynamics suggested by and related to the Kubo-Mori theory of generalized Brownian motion. This formulation leads to a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in which only the coordinates of the gas atom and the n∼1-6 surface atoms directly struck by the gas atom appear explicitly. The remainder of the lattice, which functions as a harmonic heat bath, affects the collision through a friction kernel and a Gaussian random force appearing in the GLE. The GLE can be solved in terms of a tractable number of (n+1) ‐particle gas-surface trajectories using approximate stochastic techniques. Stochastic solution yields thermally averaged temporal gas particle probability distribution functions (pdf). From the long time limit of these pdf's all temperature dependent gas-surface cross sections can be found. In the limit of zero friction, the theory gives a convenient method for calculating atom-oscillator thermally averaged cross sections which circumvents laborious Monte Carlo classical trajectory sampling and which can be generalized to treat other gas phase collision problems.},

It is shown that the many differences in scattering properties in these three excitation frequency regions may be accounted for by expressions derived from simple perturbation theory. Scattering experiments from molecular iodine are presented which test and verify the general scattering theories. Spectral measurements, time decay measurements, and pressure broadening measurements were made on I2 in the discrete resonance Raman scattering region; and spectral measurements at several excitation frequencies were made in the continuum resonance Raman scattering region.

The models, which may be refined to arbitrary precision, allow one to treat the many‐body or lattice effect in gas/solid dynamics in a qualitatively correct but computationally simple manner. Scattering calculations based on the models may be carried out using standard classical trajectory methodology; the many‐body dynamics modifies the usual classical equations of motion through noise terms and auxiliary variables. Collisional studies based on the simplest of the new models reveal the importance of many‐body dynamics on energy transfer and trapping thresholds. The percentage of energy transfer due to many‐body effects is found to be a rapidly increasing function of solid Debye temperature $\Theta$D; at $\Theta$D≳225\textdegreeK the many‐body contribution to energy transfer often exceeds the uncoupled oscillator contribution. The threshold energy for trapping on the simplest model solid is often more than doubled due to many‐body influence. Finally, helium scattering from silver is simulated and the results are compared with the measurements of Sau and Merrill.},

  abstract = {A method for calculations of the complete resonance Raman (RR) spectrum of large conjugated molecules is presented. The method is based on calculations of the Franck-Condon factors and on differentiation of the electronic transition moments with respect to the vibrational normal modes. This approach is more simple and practical than previous treatments which are based on the Herzberg-Teller expansion. It allows one to evaluate quantitatively the contributions of the A and B terms to the RR intensity pattern. This paper gives the detailed derivation of the calculation scheme and examines different possible approximations. The multimode nature of the RR process is considered in detail and the effect of combination levels is taken into account explicitly. It is shown that in cases of resonance with strong electronic transitions the A term is much more important than the B term. The calculations are demonstrated by the evaluation of the Raman spectra of butadiene and 1,3,5‐hexatriene in the nonresonance region, and by the evaluation of the RR spectra of $\beta$‐carotene, $\beta$‐ionone, and all‐trans retinal. A reasonable agreement is obtained between the calculated and observed relative intensities and excitation profiles. Applications of the calculations to cases of weak electronic transitions are also considered.},

  abstract = {In this work, we provide a simple classical model to explain the enormous intensity enhancement observed for Raman scattering from molecules adsorbed on electrode surfaces. It is proposed that the origin of the intensity enhancement arises from very large changes in the polarizability derivative with respect to a normal coordinate, by virtue of the image field at the admolecule. A qualitative discussion of the role of adsorbed counter ions is presented. We tentatively propose that the dependence of the intensity enhancement on counter ion concentration may be understood in terms of nearest neighbor dipole-dipole stabilization of surface clusters of counter ions with the adsorbate molecule. We also discuss some limitations of the classical model, and propose some further experiments that may lead to clarification of the ideas presented in this work},

  abstract = {A time‐dependent picture of vibrational Raman scattering in the weak field limit is presented. From this viewpoint we can separate the static effects, due to the coordinate dependence of the electronic transition dipole, from the dynamic effects that arise from wave packet propagation on the Born-Oppenheimer surfaces. Away from resonance, the energy uncertainty relation gives the propagation time necessary to obtain the cross section as being inversely proportional to the mismatch of the excitation frequency with the excited surface. The wave packet, given by the initial vibrational wave function times the transition dipole, hardly moves on the excited surface when the excitation frequency is far from resonance. As the excitation frequency is tuned closer to resonance, the propagated wave packet samples a larger portion of the surface. Using the short time approximation to the propagator, we obtain formulas for the cross section that are applicable for Raman scattering by polyatomics. The short time approximation is expected to be good away from resonance independent of the nature of the surface, and also on resonance with a repulsive surface. For an attractive surface, the approximation gives the average resonant cross section useful in the case when the vibrational structures cannot be observed.},

Such effects have been previously discussed by using a model in which the molecule is represented by a point dipole and its interaction with the metal is treated by using macroscopic electrodynamics. We examine critically this model and remove some of its shortcomings by developing a microscopic theory in which the interaction between the molecule and the metal is treated within the random phase approximation.

  abstract = {The point dipole interaction model for molecular polarizability recently proposed by Applequist, Carl, and Fung is modified by replacing isotropic atomic point dipoles with anisotropic atomic point dipoles. The modified formalism, which is invariant to coordinate transformations, requires an additional empirical parameter for each atom type (A, the atomic anisotropy constant) and a single, global parameter applicable to all nonconjugated systems (k, the repulsion exponent). The atomic polarizability tensor in the molecular environment is evaluated as a function of interatomic electron repulsion. This latter quantity is shown to be related to the degree to which bonding diminishes the polarizability of an atomic center in the direction(s) of the covalent bonds(s). The anisotropic atom point dipole interaction model generates identical mean molecular polarizabilities as in the isotropic procedures of Applequist et al., while reducing the average error in the calculated molecular polarizability components to $\sim$7%. This error is comparable to experimental uncertainty.},

  abstract = {In this paper equations are developed for the quantitative refinement of molecular force fields for Wilson G-F calculations through the use of molecular orbital (MO) calculations of the bond order change between the resonant excited electronic state and the ground state together with the observed intensity of the resonant Raman spectrum (RRS). The method should permit an unambiguous choice between two or more force fields which give equally good fit of the observed frequencies but which give different potential energy distributions among the internal coordinates. We have used this method to study methyl uracil, a planar ring molecule of low symmetry, where partitioning of the matrices is not possible. A least-squares calculation of the difference between the MO bond order changes and the bond order changes calculated from the force field together with the measured intensities in the RRS allows a choice of the correct sign for the excited state changes in the normal coordinates of modes which are active in the RRS. This least-squares calculation allows us to improve a previous choice of signs taken for uracil and obtain calculated excited state geometry in better agreement with bond order changes obtained from MO calculations. From our force field we have not only calculated all the in-plane vibrational frequencies but also the relative intensities for the RRS in both the 260 nm and 200 nm excited states. The theory correctly predicts that only 8 of the 21 in-plane molecules will be observed in the RRS.},

  abstract = {Raman spectra of CO condensed on vapor-deposited Ag at II K show two signals in the CO stretching region, one originating from a monolayer next to the metal, the other from the bulk CO fJIm above it. In addition, a low-frequency band associated with the former was detected, as were overtones of both the low and high-frequency bands ofthe surface CO. Raman scattering by the former was found to be some 106 times more intense than by the latter on a per molecule basis. The state of polarization of the tow signals was investigated as a function of angle of incidence, as was the excitation profJIe of the signal from the CO next to the metal, using the bulk CO signal as a reference. The behavior of the latter could only be understood when one took into account coherence effects arising from the superposition of rays directly incident on or scattered by a molecule with those reflected from the metal before impinging on, or after scattering from, the molecule. These effects could give rise to apparent polarizing or depolarizing effects and warrant attention in matrix isolation Raman spectroscopy as well as in surface Raman spectroscopy. Taking all observations into account, the enhanced Raman is suggested to be a form of resonance Raman by CO-covered, metal surface irregularities which act as "adsorbed," giant cluster compounds, the metal core of which is large enough to sustain conduction electrons, thereby allowing the conduction electron resonance to become an electronic state of the pseudoadsorbed cluster. It is this electronic state which is in resonance with the incident illumination. The relationship between this electronic resonance and surface plasma resonance in an isolated metal sphere is pointed out. The expected enhancement of molecules adsorbed on several metals other than silver is estimated in the context of the model proposed. Group IB metals are shown to be premier among the enhancers, although Cu and Au should be most efficatious in the red.},

These inhomogeneously broadened solution spectra can be described reasonably using only two harmonic normal modes of vibration: single and double bond stretches at ∼1200 and ∼1600 cm−1, respectively. Excited state normal coordinate displacements were determined by a least‐squares fitting procedure. For both the double and single bond modes the estimated change in bond length upon excitation decreases as the length of the polyene chain increases. The bandwidth of these spectra decreases with increasing polyene length. This is well described by assuming that in solution a range of conformations differing by very small torsions about the terminal single bonds has been frozen in. The Franck-Condon analysis indicates that under these conditions all of the polyenes are approximately planar in the 1Bu state, ruling out the argument that the lack of fluorescence in butadiene and hexatriene is due to the polyene framework being significantly twisted in the lowest energy 1Bu state.},

  abstract = {A model is presented for determining the enhancement of local electromagnetic fields which occurs close to rough metal surfaces through surface plasmon excitation. The model considers a random distribution of metal hemispheroids on a perfectly conducting flat plane. The electrodynamics of this system is described using the long wavelength approximation and with only the dipole coupling between different hemispheroids included. The square of the local field is averaged over all locations on the surface to provide an estimate of the enhancement in Raman intensity pertinent to surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Application is made to rough Ag, Cu, Au, Hg, and Pt surfaces, simulating the roughness produced by electrochemical anodization. For Ag, the roughness induced SERS enhancement is found to be about 10', with a weak dependence on wavelength down to 350 nm, where a sharp drop is observed. The variation of this result on the parameters which characterize the hemispheroid distributions is studied, including the variation with the distribution of hemispheroid heights and widths, with the number and arrangements of hemispheroids on the surface, with hemispheroid dielectric constant, and with hemispheroid coverage. Most of these parameters do not change the overall enhancement factors significantly, although the wavlength dependence of the enhancement does change significantly with hemispheroid coverage. The polarization of the local electric field close to the surface is studied, and found to be primarily perpendicular to the local surface for globally perpendicular applied fields. The SERS enhancement on Cu is found to be comparable to Ag for ..t > 600 nm, with a drop in intensity by a factor of 5 at 600 nm. Au is similar to Cu, except that the drop occurs at 500 nm. Hg is similar to Ag in both the magnitude and frequency dependence of the enhancement, while Pt is uniformly smaller throughout the visible. All of these enhancements are _103 smaller than is seen experimentally using SERS, although the observed change in SERS intensity due to anodization does closely match the predictions of our model. Overall, we conclude that surface roughness probably contributes 10' to 103 to the overall enhancement with a frequency dependence which is close to that seen experimentally. This conclusion indicates that some other enhancement mechanism must be responsible for the remaining factor of 103 needed to explain the observed overall enhancement of 106},

  abstract = {Lee and Heller's time‐dependent theory of resonance Raman scattering is reviewed. This theory is formally identical to the traditional Kramer-Heisenberg-Dirac (KHD) theory but, in its wave packet interpretation, the time‐dependent theory has distinct calculational and conceptual advantages over the KHD sum‐over‐states method. For polyatomics with large Franck-Condon displacements and Duschinsky rotations, where typically the KHD sum is over 1010 states with complicated Franck-Condon factors, these advantages are most pronounced. Wave packet propagation on general harmonic potential surfaces (Franck-Condon displacement, frequency shifts, and Duschinsky rotation) is exact. Formulas for the propagated wave packet are given for various levels of harmonic sophistication. The role of symmetry in the wave packet dynamics is discussed and explicit formulas are derived for the overlap of the moving wave packet \textbardblϕi(t)〉 with the final state of interest \textbardblϕf〉. The half Fourier transform of this overlap gives the Raman amplitude $\alpha$. The transform method of Tonks and Page, relating absorption and Raman excitation profiles, is shown to arise naturally in our approach. We show excitation profiles calculated by the time‐dependent theory for multidimensional harmonic potential surfaces with and without Duschinsky rotation. For the no‐Duschinsky cases, we compare our results with the profiles of Myers and Mathies and of Champion and Albrecht, which were calculated by a sum‐over‐states; we then discuss some discrepancies between the latter's results and ours.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for using a single preresonance Raman spectrum and an absorption spectrum to obtain changes in equilibrium geometry upon electronic excitation. The relative displacements along each of the vibrational normal coordinates are obtained from the Raman intensities, while the overall scaling of the displacements is determined by the absorption band shape. The absorption spectra, as well as Raman excitation profiles, are calculated using either a sum over vibronic states or a formally equivalent time-dependent method [S.-Y. Lee and E. J. Heller, J. Chem. Phys. 71, 4777 (1979)]. The time-dependent method is computationally much faster than the vibronic sum for large multidimensional systems. Our analysis, which assumes isolated molecules and separable, harmonic surfaces, yields a good fit to the vapor phase absorption spectrum of trans-hexatriene with a Lorentzian linewidth of 175 cm−1. However, the diffuse absorption spectrum of isoprene cannot be adequately reproduced using Lorentzian line shapes, even when all 33 normal modes are included. Finite temperature and excited state frequency changes are also found to have little effect on the calculated band shapes. These results suggest that inhomogeneous broadening may be a major factor, but calculations using Gaussian broadening fail to accurately reproduce the experimental spectrum.},

Calculations for the model system of ethylene adsorbed on silver. with charge-transfer excitation of an electron from the metal to the antibonding etylene $\pi$ orbital, show that charge-transfer Raman enhancements of the order of 10 to 1000 are possible if the charge-transfer band is partially resonant with the exciting radiation.

  abstract = {The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical, well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with typical values of 10' for RS, 103 for RRS and 10- 1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process. The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.},

Adjustment of diluent gas composition enables the preparation of rotationally cold (<10 K)/vibrationally hot (≊300 K) and rotationally cold/vibrationally cold samples. The collapse of rotational envelopes on cooling facilitates the accurate determinations of frequencies and relative absorption intensities of transitions both from the zero point level and from excited vibrational levels of the ground electronic state. At 49 000-51 000 cm−1, in the region of the Franck-Condon maximum, a simple vibronic pattern emerges involving two upper state vibrational modes containing both stretching and bending contributions. In this region of the spectrum, the upper state rotational structure diverges from that of a nearly symmetric top and approaches that of the linear or quasilinear molecule. At higher energies, the vibronic structure grows in complexity, suggesting increased anharmonic mixing of these nearly degenerate modes.},

Several aspects of the properties have been measured: the magnitude the temporal decay of the fluorescence, the shape and temporal evolution of the fluorescence spectrum, and the effects on the spectrum of a photochemical hole-burning process. Dramatic increases in the fluorescent decay rate and decreases in the photochemical reaction rate as well as systematic spectral shifts of the emission of molecules experiencing the different electrodynamic environments on the island film are observed. These results reveal the strong effects of the coupling between the adsorbate and the plasma resonances localized on the islands of the film. We model our results using the electrodynamic picture which has successfully described many aspects of surface-enhanced Raman scattering and other optical processes on island films. The excellent agreement between this model and our results suggests that an important feature of the electrodynamics at these rough metal surfaces is the dipolar character of the couplings between the surface, the adsorbate, and the optical fields.},

The modulation of the radiative rate is described inadequately by the classical theory for our experimental geometry. At short distances where nonradiative energy transfer to the metal is important, the classical prediction deviates from the data as well.

We incorporate the Herzberg-Teller mixing of zero-order Born-Oppenheimer electronic states by means of vibronic interaction terms in the Hamiltonian. This is similar to the theory of Tang and Albrecht12 except that we include metal states as part of a molecule-metal system. When this is done we may no longer discard a term involving mixing of ground-state vibrations. The theory is comprehensive in that both molecule-to-metal and metal-to-molecule transfer is considered. Furthermore, both Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller contributions to the intensity are obtained. The former, however, contribute only to the intensity of totally symmetric vibrations, while the latter contribute to nontotally symmetric vibrations as well. Since overtones are observed in SERS only weakly if at all, the Herzberg-Teller terms are most consistent with experimental findings. The resulting formulas may be interpreted as a type of resonance Raman effect in which intensity for the charge transfer transitions is borrowed from an allowed molecular transition. We may also carry out the sum over metal states. This procedure predicts a logarithmic resonance at the Fermi level of the metal. We thus which fits the experimental curves quite well.},

In the absence of pure dephasing, the rotational structure of a RHR vibrational transition is described, in general, by five scattering invariants which are derived in an irreducible tensor framework. The pattern of relative rotational RHR intensities is a sensitive function of the two‐photon resonant vibronic state dephasing constant. High quality rotational RHR spectra of NH3 are obtained using blue incident radiation at half the X to A transition energy. Fits to the observed patterns of relative rotational RHR intensities determine lifetimes of 38, 60, and 100 fs for the v2 =1,2,3 A state vibronic bands respectively. Although seven rotational branches (N,O,P,Q,R,S,T) are possible in HR, only three (P,Q,R) are observed in these RHR spectra of ammonia due to the magnitude and relative signs of vibronic matrix elements in the scattering cross section expressions.},

The structural parameters obtained from HFS calculations are in at least as good agreement with experiment as structures obtained from ab initio HF calculations. The time required to evaluate the energy gradient by numerical integration constitutes only a fraction (40%-25%) of the elapsed time in a full HFS‐SCF calculation.

When the method is applied to a single oscillator with cubic anharmonicity, both the classical and quantal dephasing rates are shown to be equal to the well‐known result of Oxtoby. The technique is also applied to a system with more than one vibrational degree of freedom (linear triatomic molecules) to obtain the dephasing rates for the symmetric and antisymmetric normal modes.

  abstract = {This paper presents a combined experimental and theoretical study of the hyper‐Raman spectrum of pyridine adsorbed onto roughened silver electrodes. The surface enhanced hyper‐Raman spectra (SEHRS) were measured using a focused cw mode‐locked Nd:YAG laser with a peak power density of approximately 107 W/cm2 . Dominant bands in the pyridine spectra are the same (totally symmetric) bands as have been seen in the corresponding Raman (SERS) spectrum, although the relative intensities are different. To interpret these spectra, we present a semiempirical molecular orbital method for determining excitation energies, polarizability derivatives, and hyperpolarizability derivatives that is based on the $\pi$‐electron Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) method. An empirical molecular force field is used to derive vibrational information, and the accuracy of the spectra is assessed by comparison with normal Raman spectra for liquid pyridine and with SERS spectra. The resulting SEHRS spectra are in good agreement with the measured spectra, particularly with respect to the intensity changes in the dominant lines in going from SERS to SEHRS. In addition, the theoretical/experimental comparisons indicate that SEHRS is more sensitive to adsorbate orientation than is SERS since the nontotally symmetric modes are predicted to be comparable in SEHRS (but not SERS) intensity to the totally symmetric modes for orientations other than perpendicular. Most important, a comparison of theoretical and experimental SEHRS/SERS ratios suggests that the enhancement factor associated with SEHRS is on the order of 10^13 which is much larger than the 10^6 enhancement seen for SERS.},

Absolute intensities have also been measured in CS2 vapor using 200 nm excitation. These total Raman cross sections, together with the Rayleigh cross sections calculated from the Kramers-Kronig transform of the absorption spectrum, are used to determine the homogeneous linewidth gamma for the electronic transition under the assumption that the solvent induced broadening may be partitioned into a static, inhomogeneous part and a very rapidly modulated, homogeneous component. gamma is found to be ∼13 cm-1 in the vapor and ∼200 cm-1 in cyclohexane solution, indicating that homogeneous broadening is responsible for much of the increase in spectral breadth between vapor and solution phases. Direct modeling of the solution phase absorption spectrum and the intensities of the lower lying Raman transitions gives a best fit to the absolute cross sections with a somewhat smaller gamma of ∼115 cm-1, probably due to the approximate nature of the model employed for the highly anharmonic excited state potential surface. The possible importance of solvent ``memory'' effects (finite solvent correlation time) on the electronic spectral broadening is discussed.},

Line broadening arises due to cubic anharmonicity of the vibrational mode according to known mechanism of Oxtoby of dephasing in liquids. Our approach makes it possible to take into account interaction with the bath exactly, regardless of the strength of coupling, and to develop a convenient perturbation theory in nonlinearity of the mode. It is shown that at low temperatures and for strong coupling to the bath the line shape is strongly asymmetric and cannot be described in terms of a Markovian approximation usually assumed in previous studies. Actual line shape is related to the spectrum of excitations of the bath which can be studied using data on the line shape at low temperatures. Line shapes are studied both in quantum and classical case beyond the weak coupling limit and the Markovian approximation.},

  abstract = {Our previous algorithm for following reaction paths downhill (J. Chem. Phys. 1989, 90, 2154), has been extended to use mass-weighted internal coordinates. Points on the reaction path are found by constrained optimizations involving the internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The points are optimized so that the segment of the reaction path between any two adjacent points is described by an arc of a circle in mass-weighted internal coordinates, and so that the gradients (in mass-weighted internals) at the end points of the arc are tangent to the path. The algorithm has the correct tangent vector and curvature vectors in the limit of small step size but requires only the transition vector and the energy gradients; the resulting path is continuous, differentiable, - and piecewise quadratic. Reactions paths for CH4 + H - CHI + H1, HCN - CNH, F + CH,F FCH3 + F, and C2HSF - C2H4 + HF are calculated and the results are compared to the paths obtained with mass-weighted Cartesians and with internal coordinates without mass-weighting.},

The associated vibronic band systems and their spectroscopic assignments are discussed together with the physical and chemical conditions governing ion production in the solid phase. The absorption coefficients were calculated for the ion and found lower than previous values, presumably due to the low polarizability of the neon matrix. This study presents the first spectroscopic data for naphthalene trapped in a neon matrix, where the perturbation of the isolated species by its environment is minimum; a condition crucial to astrophysical applications.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for the calculation of energy gradients has been implemented into the linear combination of atomic orbitals‐Hartree-Fock-Slater (LCAO‐HFS) program due to Baerends et al. [Chem. Phys. 2, 41 (1973)], and tested in connection with geometry optimizations of transition‐metal complexes, organic molecules and compounds of main group elements. The algorithm is based on a self‐consistent nonlocal density‐functional method (NL‐SCF) combining the nonlocal exchange correction by Becke [Phys. Rev. A 38, 3098 (1988)] with the nonlocal correlation correction by Perdew [Phys. Rev. B 33, 8822 (1986)]. It is shown that nonlocal corrections to the local‐density approximation (LDA) improves the calculated metal‐ligand bond distances considerably. Full optimizations of MnO−4, Cr(CO)6, Mo(CO)6, Fe(CO)5, Ni(CO)4, HMn(CO)5, HCo(CO)4, Fe(C5H5)2, and C5H5NiNO revealed that the LDA underestimates metal‐ligand bond distances by an average of 0.05 \r A, whereas nonlocal corrections, on the average, reduce the error to 0.01 \r A. Nonlocal corrections are not as important for organic molecules and compounds of main group elements where LDA already affords bond distances in good agreement with experiment. Bond angles are, in general, not influenced much by nonlocal corrections. The nonlocal corrections increase the computational time involved by a factor of 4 on a scalar machine and a factor of 2 on a vector machine.},

The constrained space-orbital variation method has been used extensively to decompose the chemisorption bond for adsorbates on surfaces into, in particular, intraunit polarizations and interunit donations or covalent bonding. The results obtained for different orders of the intraunit and interunit constrained variations are compared for the representative examples of CO/Cu and O/Cu. For CO/Cu, both orders indicate the same dominant bonding mechanism, but for O/Cu they give very different views of the importance of the Cu 3d contribution to the Cu-O covalent bond. When the results for the two orders are not the same, a different division of the variational space for the constrained variations is needed. An appropriate division of the space for the Cu-O bond into contracted orbitals and diffuse orbitals is described.},

The results are compared to previous studies on the C-H insertion reaction in methane and the N-H insertion reaction in ammonia. The molecular complexes are found to be weaker bound than the corresponding ammonia adducts. The insertion products are stronger bound for the atoms to the left and slightly weaker bound for the atoms to the very right than the products of the ammonia reaction. The barrier heights are in all cases lower for the ammonia reaction. The presence of two lone pairs in water which are bound more tightly than the single lone pair in ammonia is of key importance to explain these trends.},

  abstract = {Ab initio and semiempirical molecular orbital methods have been used to calculate the bulk and surface Raman and hyperRaman spectra of pyridine. Similar calculations for benzene are also reported. For both molecules, we compare the results with available bulk and surface experiments. In all calculations, the polarizability and hyperpolarizability derivatives are evaluated using normal coordinates that are obtained from Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. The Raman results are somewhat sensitive to the basis set used in determining the normal coordinates, and the hyper‐Raman spectra are strongly sensitive. The Raman and hyper‐Raman spectra have been calculated at zero frequency using HF methods (GAUSSIAN 90), and finite frequency using INDO (intermediate neglect of differential overlap) methods (zindo). The frequency dependence of the results is found to be minor. Comparisons with experiment indicate that the inclusion of diffuse basis functions is crucial to the accuracy of the HF calculations. For such basis sets, the benzene Raman and hyper‐Raman spectra provided by HF are in excellent agreement with experiment. Raman spectra from HF for pyridine also agree well, but hyper‐Raman spectra agree only in part. Changes in Raman and hyper‐Raman spectra calculated in going from bulk to surface generally agree with observations. The corresponding bulk and surface spectra from zindo are usually less accurate, especially the hyper‐Raman spectra, and especially the out of plane modes. Estimates of the surface hyper‐Raman enhancement factor are in the range 10^{11}-10^{12} for pyridine on silver electrodes.},

  abstract = {The first resonance Raman and hyper‐Raman scattering from naphthalene are reported. Fourth harmonic of a mode‐locked Nd:YAG laser is used to resonantly excite the 1B1u+ transition, producing Raman spectra that confirm the dominance of the vibronically active $\nu$28 (b3g) mode and the Franck-Condon active ag modes, $\nu$5 and $\nu$3. A synchronously pumped stilbene dye laser and its second harmonic are employed as the excitation sources for hyper‐Raman and Raman scattering from the overlapping 1B2u+ and 1Ag− states. The Raman spectra indicate that the equilibrium geometry of naphthalene is distorted primarily along $\nu$5, $\nu$8, and $\nu$7 normal coordinates upon excitation to 1B2u+. The hyper‐Raman spectrum shows that $\nu$25 (b2u) is the mode principally responsible for vibronic coupling between the 1Ag− and 1B2u+ states. The results demonstrate the advantageous features of resonance hyper‐Raman scattering for the case of overlapping one‐ and two‐photon allowed transitions. Calculations based on simple molecular orbital configurations are shown to qualitatively agree with the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Frequently it is useful to compare experimental values of the hyperpolarizabilities $\beta$ and $\gamma$ with calculated values. It is also often helpful to compare experimental values of $\beta$ obtained from dc‐electric field induced second harmonic generation (dc‐SHG) experiments, e.g., with values obtained using the solvatochromism method. In order to do this the hyperpolarizabilities must be defined using consistent conventions. In this paper, four commonly used conventions are discussed and simple factors for converting between them presented. In addition, the sum‐over‐states expression for the calculation of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ is described and its correct use in comparing with hyperpolarizabilities obtained using other experimental and theoretical techniques discussed. As an illustration of the consistent use of conventions, ab initio and semiempirical calculations on para‐nitroaniline are compared with experimental dc‐SHG values. This comparison highlights the difference between theoretical values of the hyperpolarizability with the molecule in a gas phase environment and experimental values obtained in polar solvents−a difference that has in the past been obscured by inconsistent choice of conventions.  },

Spectra excited in the 246-274 nm region, on resonance with the directly dissociative A state, exhibit overtone progressions in the C-I stretch and its combination bands with the methyl umbrella mode. The fundamental of the C-I stretch is weak relative to the overtones when excited near the peak of the A band, an effect shown to arise from interferences between the resonant amplitude and preresonant contributions from higher electronic states. Both the absorption spectrum and the Raman excitation profiles are quite similar in solution and vapor phases, suggesting that the dissociative A state is not strongly perturbed by solvation. This conclusion is consistent with a simple theoretical estimate of the solvation effect on the A state potential.},

In analogy to linear resonance Raman spectroscopy, the RHR band shapes and polarization are found to be a sensitive function of the two‐photon resonant vibronic state lifetime and detuning. The dependence of these scattering characteristics on the two‐photon excited‐state dephasing constant provides a technique for determining subpicosecond predissociation rates via nonlinear spontaneous Raman scattering. Theoretical fits to the observed resonant rovibrational hyper‐Raman depolarization ratio dispersion curves are obtained for a vibronic B‐state lifetime of 0.5\textpm0.2 ps. This lifetime value is in agreement with previous results obtained from linear resonance Raman scattering studies.

The standard 6‐31G∗ basis set was used for orbital expansion, and self‐consistent Kohn-Sham orbitals were obtained by all DFT methods, without employing any auxiliary fitting techniques. Comparison with experimental results shows the density functional geometries and dipole moments to be generally no better than or inferior to those predicted by the conventional ab initio methods with this particular basis set. The density functional vibrational frequencies compare favorably with the ab initio results, while for atomization energies, two of the DFT methods give excellent agreement with experiment and are clearly superior to all other methods considered.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive overview of the equation of motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) method and its application to molecular systems is presented. By exploiting the biorthogonal nature of the theory, it is shown that excited state properties and transition strengths can be evaluated via a generalized expectation value approach that incorporates both the bra and ket state wave functions. Reduced density matrices defined by this procedure are given by closed form expressions. For the root of the EOM-CC effective Hamiltonian that corresponds to the ground state, the resulting equations are equivalent to the usual expressions for normal single-reference CC density matrices. Thus, the method described in this paper provides a universal definition of coupled-cluster density matrices, providing a link between EOM-CC and traditional ground state CC theory. Excitation energy, oscillator strength, and property calculations are illustrated by means of several numerical examples, including comparisons with full configuration interaction calculations and a detailed study of the ten lowest electronically excited states of the cyclic isomer of C4.},

  abstract = {General theoretical expressions for the dephasing and energy relaxation times of a stiff oscillator in simple fluids are derived from the GLE and a critical discussion of the dynamic processes in these systems is given. In addition new methodological aspects of stochastic and full molecular dynamics simulations are discussed. The new reversible integrator based on the Trotter factorization of the classical propagator is used to directly simulate the vibrational energy and phase relaxation of a stiff classical oscillator dissolved in a Lennard‐Jones bath. We compare the ``real'' relaxation from full MD simulations with that predicted by Kubo theory and by the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) with memory friction determined from the full molecular dynamics. It is found that the GLE gives very good agreement with MD for the vibrational energy relaxation, even for nonlinear oscillators far from equilibrium. The dephasing relaxation is also well approximated by the GLE.},

  abstract = {The higher‐order response theory to derive frequency‐dependent polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities is examined by means of the differentiation of the ``quasienergy'' with respect to the strengths of the time‐dependent external field, which is referred to as the quasienergy derivative (QED) method. This method is the extension of the energy derivative method to obtain static polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities to a time‐dependent perturbation problem. The form of the quasienergy W = <$\Phi$\textbardblH − i(∂/∂t)\textbardbl$\Phi$> is determined from the time‐dependent Hellmann-Feynman theorem. The QED method is accomplished when the total sum of the signed frequencies of the associated field strengths, with respect to which the quasienergy is differentiated, is equated to 0. The QED method is applied to the single exponential‐transformation (SET) ansatz (up to the fifth‐order QEDs) and the double exponential‐transformation (DET) ansatz (up to the fourth‐order QEDs), where the time‐dependent variational principle (TDVP) is employed to optimize the time development of the system. The SET ansatz covers the full configuration interaction (CI) response and the Hartree-Fock response (i.e., the TDHF approximation), while the DET ansatz covers the multiconfiguration self‐consistent field (MCSCF) response (i.e., the TDMCSCF approximation) and the limited CI response with relaxed orbitals. Since the external field treated in this paper is always ``polychromatic,'' the response properties explicitly presented for both the SET and DET ans\"atze are $\mu$A, $\alpha$AB(−$\omega$;$\omega$), $\beta$ABC(−$\omega$$\sigma$;$\omega$1,$\omega$2), and $\gamma$ABCD(−$\omega$$\sigma$;$\omega$1,$\omega$2,$\omega$3), in addition $\delta$ABCDE(−$\omega$$\sigma$;$\omega$1,$\omega$2,$\omega$3,$\omega$4) is presented for the SET ansatz. All variational formulas for these response properties derived in this study automatically satisfy the (2n+1) rule with respect to the variational parameters.  },

  abstract = {Approximate density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study four elementary processes on the singlet ground state energy surface of H2CO. The elementary steps include the elimination of H-2 and CO from formaldehyde, the transformation of formaldehyde to transhydroxymethylene, the isomerization of trans-hydroxymethylene to cis-hydroxymethylene, and the 1,2 elimination of H2 from cis-hydroxymethylene. The DFT studies were based on the local density approximation (LDA) as well as a nonlocal self-consistent field (NL-SCF) extension in which Perdew's correlation correction and Becke's exchange correction were added to LDA. Fully optimized structures as well as harmonic vibrational frequencies have been evaluated for all of the stationary points corresponding to the reactants, products, and transition states for the four reactions within the LDA and NL-SCF approximations. The four reactions have in addition been studied by the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method in which stationary points on the potential energy surface are connected by a steepest energy path. It is concluded that the NL-SCF-method affords as good an overall fit to experiment as the fourth-order Moller-Plesset single, double, triple, and quadruple excitations {[}MP4(SDTQ)]/6-31G{*}{*}//MP2/6-31G{*} scheme for the S0 surface of H2CO. The DFT methods tend to afford energies for the stationary points which are too low compared to the separate species H-2 + CO, whereas the corresponding MP4 energies are too high. This is in particular the case for the local LDA method. We attribute this trend to a bias in favor of bond formation among the DFT methods. The reaction paths for LDA and NL-SCF were found to be very similar, and it is suggested that one might combine geometries evaluated by the less demanding LDA method with energies obtained by the more accurate and involved NL-SCF scheme.},

  abstract = {The four e2g false origin bands and the a1g progression of the S0(1Ag)-S1(1B2u) transition in benzene are simulated ab initio with the recently introduced configuration interaction singles (CIS) with 6‐31G orbitals. The ground and excited state CC and CH bond lengths are optimized and compared with the experiment; the CC bond elongation upon excitation is found to be slightly underestimated. The vibrational force fields are calculated at the stationary points of S0 and S1. The 1Ag force field is calculated at the Hartree-Fock level while the 1B2u force field is calculated at the CIS level of theory. The two force fields are scaled to fit the experimental frequencies and the normal mode rotation upon excitation, i.e., the Duschinsky matrix, is obtained. In agreement with previous empirical fitting of the S1(1B2u) vibrational frequencies, the Duschinsky matrix is found to be nearly diagonal with the exception of the b2u modes submatrix which shows a large amount of mixing. The mixing of the b2u modes is larger before scaling but is subsequently reduced after scaling. The normal modes and the optimized geometries are used to calculate the amount of displacement, upon excitation, of the equilibrium position of the totally symmetric modes. This displacement causes the Franck-Condon progression and is slightly underestimated by the calculation. The intensity of the four e2g false origins in the absorption spectrum of S1 is calculated and the Herzberg-Teller intensities of the four bands are found to be very close to the experiment. In particular, the relative intensity of the CCC bend ($\nu$6) and CC stretch ($\nu$8) bands is nicely reproduced. This result is discussed in light of similar calculations at the semiempirical level of theory. We conclude that CIS can be of great value for the unravelling of vibronic spectra of conjugated systems.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast pump-probe measurements on the electron donor-acceptor complex of tetracyanoethylene with hexamethylbenzene in polar and nonpolar solvents are reported. Ground state coherence in the complex stretching mode at 165 cm−1 excited by impulsive stimulated Raman scattering is observed as well as decay of the ground state bleaching signal due to return electron transfer to the ground state. The experimental electron‐transfer rates are compared with nonadiabatic and adiabatic electron‐transfer theories using a previously published analysis of all the vibrational modes active in the reaction. It is shown that a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can give rise to a coupling that leads to the observed electron‐transfer reaction. The non‐Born-Oppenheimer matrix element is estimated using information obtained from the absorption and Raman spectra. Using this coupling, good agreement is found between the experimentally observed and theoretically predicted rates. Caveats of the various theories, the reliability of the normal mode analysis, and aspects of electron transfer that theory should address are discussed.},

For representing the surface effect, we use small solid clusters Ag2, Ag10, K2, Pd2, and MgO. The present method succeeds in describing the enhancement of the Raman intensity for the adsorbed CO molecule. The maximum intensity of the Ag10CO system is calculated to be seven orders of magnitude larger than that of the free CO molecule. Furthermore, the wavelength dependence of the Raman intensity calculated by the Ag10CO system agrees with the experimental spectrum. The electronic mechanism of the SERS is due to the resonance transitions, in which the surface polarization and the surface-molecule interaction are very important. This mechanism explains the orientation- and distance-dependencies in the surface-adsorbate interacting systems.},

Based on recent ab initio CASSCF (complete‐ active‐space‐self‐consistent‐field) and MRCI (multireference configuration interaction) calculations of Woywod et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 100, 1400 (1994)], we construct a vibronic coupling model of the conically intersecting S1 and S2 states of pyrazine, which includes the seven most relevant vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule. Employing a time‐dependent approach that treats the intramolecular couplings in a nonperturbative manner, we calculate RR cross sections for this model, taking explicitly into account the nonseparability of all vibrational modes. The combination of high‐level ab initio calculations and multimode propagation techniques makes it possible, for the first time, to make first‐principles predictions of RR spectra for vibronically coupled electronic states of an aromatic molecule. The theoretical data are compared to experimental gas‐phase RR spectra which have been obtained for five different excitation wavelengths. The comparison reveals that the ab initio predictions match the experimental results in almost every detail. \textcopyright 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

Time-dependent Density Functional Theory is used within the Adiabatic Local Density Approximation (ALDA). Contrary to earlier studies with this approximation, our implementation applies to arbitrary closed-shell molecular systems. Our results for the isotropic part of the Van der Waals dispersion energy are of comparable quality as those obtained in TDCHF calculations. The ALDA results for the relative anisotropy of the dipole dispersion energy compare favorably to TDCHF and MBPT results. Two semi-empirical ways to calculate the dispersion energy anisotropy are evaluated. Large bases which include diffuse functions are necessary for a good description of the frequency-dependent properties considered here.},

The vibronically induced mixing of the Ag with the Bu states is best simulated when polarization, i.e., d, functions are added to the basis set of atomic orbitals. Normal mode rotation upon electronic excitation plays an important role in the intensity distribution of the bu false origins. The progressions of the totally symmetric modes built on the bu bands is satisfactorily simulated at the CASSCF/6‐31G∗ level. The calculations also show that the overtones of at least four out‐of‐plane modes should be present in the spectra whose assignment is tentatively proposed. Through comparison of the pure electronic intensities calculated for cis-trans octatetraene with the vibronically induced intensities of trans-trans octatetraene, it is found that the presence of a cis linkage induces a spectral perturbation similar to that of the most active bu mode.},

This centrosymmetric molecule is expected to have no common Raman and hyper‐Raman lines provided that it is not strongly perturbed by adsorption on the surface. The measured SERS spectrum, obtained under electrochemical conditions on Ag film over nanosphere (AgFON) electrodes, shows a well defined C=C stretch band that is not seen in the SEHRS spectrum, but many of the other bands overlap closely. We use ab initio calculations for isolated BPE to assign the spectra, and find excellent agreement between the calculated and measured IR and SERS spectra, and good agreement between the calculated and measured SEHRS spectrum. We find that the apparently overlapping IR, SERS, and SEHRS bands are in fact due to modes that have similar vibrational characteristics but different symmetry. Our results indicate that SEHRS spectra are consistent with the expected (three photon) selection rules and intensities. This rules out an alternative mechanism in which the observed spectrum arises from surface second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SERS excited at the second harmonic frequency.},

The lowest energy structures of NiN clusters for N=24-55 are dissimilar generally to those of both rare gas clusters and fragments of the bulk crystal lattice except where a stable icosahedral or bulk core is present. The growth scheme for N<50 is determined by the stability and structure of the changing number of core atoms.

The measured chromophores include representatives from C1, Cs, C2V, and D3 molecular point groups and include both neutral and ionic compounds. The measurements were made with 2-5 cm−1 spectral resolution and include polarization analysis of the incident and scattered light. Polarization ratios were measured with 2%-3% uncertainty for each molecule, and relative magnitudes of the hyperpolarizability components were deduced. Two‐photon induced fluorescence from several chromophores was observed to overlap with the scattered second harmonic light spectrum. The use of a scanning monochromator, however, generally allows the separation of these two sources of photons. The measured first hyperpolarizabilities are consistent with previous electric field induced second harmonic generation measurements of the same compounds, provided that the standard reference value for the nonlinear susceptibility of quartz is taken to be d11=0.30\textpm0.02 pm/V at 1064 nm.},

We introduce a method which achieves O(L(3)) scaling by rotating the expansions such that translation is always along the quantization or Z axis. Tt retains the FMM error bound. An overall speedup approaching a factor of 3 for relatively high orders of multipoles (L=21) is demonstrated. This procedure makes high accuracy potential evaluations substantially more efficient.},

Though the absorption spectra of the dye are the same in the protonated and deuterated forms of the solvent, Raman cross sections for all modes were found to be lower in CD3CN solution than in CH3CN. Wave packet theory has been applied to model the absorption and Raman profiles, using a solvent dephasing model which accounts for bimodal solvent dynamics. The solvent isotope effect on the Raman intensities is interpreted in terms of different amplitudes of the fast solvent response in the protonated and deuterated solvents, and possible coupling of low-frequency solute and solvent modes. The solvent reorganization energy greatly exceeds that due to internal vibrational modes of betaine-30, and most of the internal reorganization is due to the torsional modes of the solute.},

  abstract = {The generalized gradient-approximated (GGA) energy functionals used in density functional theory (DFT) provide accurate results for many different properties. However, one of their weaknesses lies in the fact that Van der Waals forces are not described. In spite of this, it is possible to obtain reliable long-range potential energy surfaces within DFT. In this paper, we use time-dependent density functional response theory to obtain the Van der Waals dispersion coefficients C6, C7, and C8 (both isotropic and anisotropic). They are calculated from the multipole polarizabilities at imaginary frequencies of the two interacting molecules. Alternatively, one might use one of the recently-proposed Van der Waals energy functionals for well-separated systems, which provide fairly good approximations to our isotropic results. Results with the local density approximation (LDA), Becke-Perdew (BP) GGA and the Van Leeuwen-Baerends (LB94) exchange-correlation potentials are presented for the multipole polarizabilities and the dispersion coefficients of several rare gases, diatomics and the water molecule. The LB94 potential clearly performs best, due to its correct Coulombic asymptotic behavior, yielding results which are close to those obtained with many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The LDA and BP results are systematically too high for the isotropic properties. This becomes progressively worse for the higher dispersion coefficients. The results for the relative anisotropies are quite satisfactory for all three potentials, however.},

  abstract = {Raman excitation profiles for twelve vibrational modes of the solvatochromic dye betaine-30 have been measured in CH3OH and CD3OD solutions at wavelengths that span the S0 to S1 charge transfer transition. Though the absorption spectra of the dye are the same in the protonated and deuterated forms of the solvent, Raman cross-sections for all modes were found to be generally lower in the CH3OH solution than in CD3OD. The time-dependent theory of Heller was applied to model the absorption and Raman profiles, and both mono- and bi-exponential solvent relaxation were considered in order to account for solvent induced electronic dephasing. The two models lead to different physical pictures for the relevant solvent dynamics, but in either case the amplitude of solvent dephasing is reduced in deuterated compared to protonated methanol. The effect is interpreted in terms of stronger solvent-solute and solvent-solvent hydrogen bonding in deuterated methanol solution. Comparing to previous results for betaine-30 Raman cross-sections in acetonitrile [Y. Zong and J. L. McHale, J. Chem. Phys. 106, 4963 (1997)], it is concluded that slower solvent dynamics and perturbations to the electronic structure of betaine-30 lead to larger Raman intensities in methanol. The data suggest that solvent dynamics depend strongly on the electronic state of betaine-30.},

It has been observed that for many totally symmetric fundamentals viz. C-N, N=N stretch, etc., the resonance Raman intensities decrease near the maxima of the resonant electronic (2 1Ag<--1 1Ag) transition. This is attributed to interference due to preresonant scattering from the strongly allowed (1 1Au<--1 1Ag) electronic transition. The Raman excitation profiles (REPs) for the ten Franck-Condon active fundamentals have been successfully modeled using Heller's time-dependent approach with the inclusion of interference effect from higher electronic state. The short time isomerization dynamics is then examined from a priori knowledge of ground-state normal mode descriptions to convert the wave packet motion in dimensionless normal coordinates to internal coordinates. It is observed that within 5-30 fs of photoexcitation, the major changes experienced by trans-azobenzene are on N=N and C-N stretching vibrations, while N=N suffers reduction, C-N bond elongates, and with time the ring C atoms distort relatively out of the plane.},

Simulations of the surface-enhanced Raman spectra and electron energy loss spectra (EELS) of pyromellitic dianhydride adsorbed on Cu(100) and Cu(111) are reported. The surface enhanced Raman spectra [J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 92, 4775 (1996)] and the EEL spectra are shown to be sensitive to crystal face. The relevant excited state observed in the EEL spectrum is not intrinsic to molecular PMDA, but results from chemisorption. The Raman spectra are sensitive to the incident laser polarization on both the (100) and (111) surfaces but in different ways. These observations are shown to be a result of the excited state potential energy surface having different shape, and the respective transition dipole moment having a different orientation on the two crystal faces. The nuclear coordinate dependence of the electronic transition dipole moment produces mode selective, polarization dependent Raman scattering cross sections. Based upon this observation we conclude that the transition dipole moment function that couples the ground electronic state to the resonant excited electronic state is also sensitive to the structure of the metal surface.},

For crystal violet we found experimentally that both HRS and two-photon absorption induced fluorescence give the same depolarization ratio for the signal. This shows that the depolarization measurement is generally not useful for distinguishing HRS from an unwanted fluorescence contribution. A theoretical explanation of the equality of the depolarization ratio for the two processes is given. Spectral study shows that signals from HRS and two-photon excited fluorescence for crystal violet are well separated to allow the measurement of $\beta$ by standard HRS technique. A modified external reference method is developed to deal with the measurement of $\beta$ by HRS for molecules that absorb the second harmonic light. The resulting $\beta$ value for crystal violet is 1140\texttimes10−30 esu, which is considerably smaller than the literature value but still amounts to a factor of 33 compared to that of p-nitroaniline.},

It preserves the highly optimized structure of conventional direct self-consistent held (SCF) methods with only negligible prescreening overhead and does not impose predefined decay properties. Our LinK method leads to very early advantages as compared to conventional methods for systems with larger band gaps. Due to negligible screening overhead it is also competitive with conventional SCF schemes both for small molecules and systems with small band gaps. For the formation of an exchange-type matrix in coupled perturbed SCF theory our LinK method can exhibit sublinear scaling, or more precisely, independence of the computational effort from molecular size.},

It recovers a nonoscillatory local-spin density (LSD) approximation to the exchange hole for a vanishing density gradient. The model hole reproduces the exchange energy density of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange, and facilitates a detailed understanding of the PBE GGA. The hole model is applied to atoms and molecules, and a comparison is made to exact and LSD angle- and system-averaged exchange holes. We find that the GGA hole model significantly improves upon the LSD model. Furthermore, the GGA hole model accurately describes the change in the exchange hole upon the formation of single bonds, but is less accurate for the formation of multiple bonds, where it misses the appearance of a long-range tail.},

  abstract = {Conventional continuum exchange-correlation functionals (e.g., local density approximation, generalized gradient approximation) offer a poor description of many response properties, such as static polarizabilities and single photon vertical excitation energies to Rydberg states. These deficiencies are related to errors in the virtual Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues, which arise due to a fundamental deficiency in the potentials of conventional continuum functionals. Namely, although these potentials approximately average over the exact integer discontinuity in energetically important regions, they fail to do so asymptotically, because they vanish. Our recent functional HCTH [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 6264 (1998)] was designed with this deficiency in mind, although its potential still fails to exhibit the appropriate asymptotic form. In this paper, we present a new procedure that explicitly corrects this asymptotic deficiency for any continuum functional. Self-consistent Kohn-Sham calculations are performed using a corrected potential, which equals the conventional potential delta EXC[rhoalpha,rhobeta]/delta rhosigma(r) in energetically important regions, but which asymptotically behaves in the required average manner -(1/r) + Isigma + epsilonHOMO,sigma. The quantity -(1/r) is determined using a nonlocal expression; Isigma is an approximate sigma spin ionization potential; and epsilonHOMO,sigma is the highest occupied sigma spin eigenvalue. By applying this correction to the HCTH potential, we accurately reproduce the hydrogen atom eigenvalue spectrum, without significantly changing the total energy. We determine corrected orbitals and eigenvalues for a variety of molecules, and use them to compute excitation energies and static polarizabilities. We compare the results with those from a variety of other exchange-correlation functionals. Excitations to Rydberg states are determined as accurately as those to valence states; for CO, N2, H2CO, and C2H4, mean absolute errors are less than 0.35 eV. The static isotropic polarizabilities of 14 small molecules are of MP2 quality.},

  abstract = {DFT schemes based on conventional and less conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals have been employed to determine the polarizability and second hyperpolarizability of $\pi$-conjugated polyacetylene chains. These functionals fail in one or more of several ways: (i) the correlation correction to $\alpha$ is either much too small or in the wrong direction, leading to an overestimate; (ii) $\gamma$ is significantly overestimated; (iii) the chain length dependence is excessively large, particularly for $\gamma$ and for the more alternant system; and (iv) the bond length alternation effects on $\gamma$ are either underestimated or qualitatively incorrect. The poor results with the asymptotically correct van Leeuwen-Baerends XC potential show that the overestimations are not related to the asymptotic behavior of the potential. These failures are described in terms of the separate effects of the exchange and the correlation parts of the XC functionals. They are related to the short-sightedness of the XC potentials which are relatively insensitive to the polarization charge induced by the external electric field at the chain ends},

For large molecules, Hartree-Fock theory was until recently the only available ab initio approach. However, correlation effects are usually very important for this property, which makes it desirable to have a computationally efficient approach in which those effects are (approximately) taken into account. We have recently shown that frequency-dependent hyperpolarizabilities can be efficiently obtained using time-dependent density functional theory. Here, we shall present the necessary theoretical framework and the details of our implementation in the Amsterdam Density Functional program. Special attention will be paid to the use of fit functions for the density and to numerical integration, which are typical of density functional codes. Numerical examples for He, CO, and para-nitroaniline are presented, as evidence for the correctness of the equations and the implementation.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present time-dependent density functional calculations on frequency-dependent first ($\beta$) and second ($\gamma$) hyperpolarizabilities for the set of small molecules, N2, CO2, CS2, C2H4, NH3, CO, HF, H2O, and CH4, and compare them to Hartree-Fock and correlated ab initio calculations, as well as to experimental results. Both the static hyperpolarizabilities and the frequency dispersion are studied. Three approximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) potential are used: the widely used Local Density Approximation (LDA), the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), as well as the asymptotically correct Van Leeuwen-Baerends (LB94) potential. For the functional derivatives of the xc potential the Adiabatic Local Density Approximation (ALDA) is used. We have attempted to estimate the intrinsic quality of these methods by using large basis sets, augmented with several diffuse functions, yielding good agreement with recent numerical static LDA results. Contrary to claims which have appeared in the literature on the basis of smaller studies involving basis sets of lesser quality, we find that the static LDA results for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are severely overestimated, and do not improve upon the (underestimated) Hartree-Fock results. No improvement is provided by the BLYP potential which suffers from the same incorrect asymptotic behavior as the LDA potential. The results are however clearly improved upon by the LB94 potential, which leads to underestimated results, slightly improving the Hartree-Fock results. The LDA and BLYP potentials overestimate the frequency dependence as well, which is once again improved by the LB94 potential. Future improvements are expected to come from improved models for asymptotically correct exchange-correlation potentials. Apart from the LB94 potential used in this work, several other asymptotically correct potentials have recently been suggested in the literature and can also be expected to improve considerably upon the relatively poor LDA and GGA results, for both the static properties and their frequency dependence.},

  abstract = {A resonance Raman intensity analysis is performed on the intramolecular charge-transfer molecule 1-aza-adamantane-4-ylidenemalononitrile in acetonitrile solution. We explore the extent to which changes in molecular structure upon charge transfer can be obtained from resonance Raman intensity analysis, and extend the analysis method for charge-transfer excitation to take into account the possible influence of nearby locally excited states. Absolute scattering cross sections are measured at five excitation wavelengths spanning both the charge-transfer band at 324 nm and the lowest locally excited band at 231 nm, and the absorption spectra and resonance Raman intensities are modeled self-consistently to obtain the mode-specific reorganization energies accompanying electronic excitation to both states. Interference effects between the two states are considered but are found to be of minimal importance for this particular charge-transfer molecule. The reorganization parameters in terms of dimensionless normal coordinates are converted to actual bond length and bond angle changes by making use of a previously developed ground-state normal mode analysis and by comparing with electronic structure calculations on models for the donor and acceptor ends to reduce the indeterminacy in the signs of the dimensionless displacements. The geometry changes upon excitation to the LE state are dominated by lengthening of the ethylenic C=C bond, while for CT excitation the distortions are distributed over the donor, acceptor, and adamantane bridge, with a smaller C=C bond length change.},

Coupling strength integration, which connects a noninteracting system with an interacting system, is introduced by using the time-dependent Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Coupled perturbed time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations are derived from the variational condition to the quasienergy functional with respect to parameters. Explicit expressions for frequency-dependent polarizability and first hyperpolarizability are given by the quasienergy derivative method. Excitation energies and transition moments are defined from poles and residues of frequency-dependent polarizabilities, respectively. In contrast to the previous theory, our formulation has the following three advantages: (1) The time-dependent exchange-correlation potential is defined by the functional derivative of the exchange-correlation quasienergy. (2) The formal expression for frequency-dependent polarizability, which corresponds to the exact sumover-states expression, can be obtained. (3) Explicit expressions for response properties which satisfy the 2n+1 rule can be automatically obtained.},

  abstract = {The atom and symmetry specific properties of x-ray emission spectroscopy have been applied to the investigation of CO adsorbed on Ni(100) and Cu(100) surfaces. In comparison to ab initio electronic structure calculations, obtained in density functional theory, we develop a consistent electronic structure model of CO adsorption on transition and noble metals and extend to a conceptual model of the surface chemical bond. A strong CO-substrate interaction is found, characterized by significant hybridization of the initial CO orbitals and the metal bands. In the pi system an allylic configuration is found as the result of orbital mixing between the CO 1 pi, 2 pi{*} and the metal d(pi)-band which is manifested experimentally in the observation of an oxygen lone-pair state. In the sigma system experimental evidence of equally strong orbital mixing has been found. Energetically, the adsorbate-substrate complex is stabilized by the pi-interaction but is destabilized by the sigma-interaction. Furthermore, the internal C-O bond carried by the pi-interaction is weakened upon adsorption, which is opposite for the internal C-O sigma bond that is strengthened. The equilibrium properties of CO adsorbed on these metals are found to be the direct result of the balance between the sigma- and pi-interactions; both in terms of the total energy and the local bond properties.},

  abstract = {he method of calculating distributed polarizabilities is extended to the first and second dipole hyperpolarizabilities, in order to describe more accurately the molecular response to strong and inhomogeneous external time-dependent electric fields. The dipolar response is expressed in terms of both potential related charge-density response functions and electric field related dipole-density response functions. The macroscopic linear, quadratic, and cubic optical dipole susceptibilities of molecular crystals are expressed in terms of the distributed (hyper) polarizabilities. This formulation differs from previous theories using distributed dipoles in that it allows for a rigorous treatment of both local induced dipoles and charge flow between different regions of the molecule. As an example, the distributed polarizabilities and first hyperpolarizabilities of urea at the self-consistent-field level are used to calculate the linear and quadratic susceptibilities of the urea crystal. The linear susceptibility does not differ substantially from that calculated with previous less rigorous models for distributed response, but the quadratic susceptibility is about 50% of that calculated with previous models. This indicates that the present treatment of distributed response should give a quadratic susceptibility in good agreement with experimental data, once the effects of electronic correlation, frequency dispersion, and the permanent crystal field are taken into account.},

  abstract = {A new general procedure to interpret surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra has been developed in order to clarify the controversy concerning the relevant enhancement mechanism of this type of spectra. The analysis consists of detecting the presence of the charge transfer (CT) enhancement mechanism by correlating the most enhanced SERS bands with the ab initio calculated geometries ($\Delta$Q) and vibrational frequencies ($\Delta$v) of the isolated molecule and its radical anion. This CT mechanism is assumed to be identical to that of resonance Raman between the electronic ground state of the metal-adsorbate complex and charge transfer excited states. We consider that these excited states arise when one electron is transferred from the metal to pyrazine. For this reason, they have been labeled from the point of view of pyrazine on the basis on the symmetry of the doublet states of its radical anion. The SERS spectra of pyrazine recorded on silver surface at several electrode potentials have been analyzed on the basis of the Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller contributions related to 2B3u-1Ag and 2Au-1Ag transitions. A great deal of experimental facts related to the relative enhancement of in-plane Ag, B3g, and B1u modes as well as out-of-plane B3u, B2g, and Au vibrations has been explained. Likewise, it is possible to account for the observation of Raman inactive fundamentals as well as the influence of the forbidden 2Au-1Ag transition on the SERS spectra if the symmetry of the metal-adsorbate complex and the nonplanarity of the 2Au state are taken into account. All the results point out that the CT mechanism is mainly responsible for the SERS features of this molecule studied here.},

Measurements were done in chloroform solution, in the visible range (450-650 nm), and for nanosecond time-duration pulses. The two-photon absorption (TPA) spectrum, obtained by the up-conversion fluorescence method, shows a resonance at $\lambda$=534 nm with a cross-section $\sigma$TPA=60 10−50 cm4⋅s/photon-molecule. Semiempirical quantum chemistry calculation on fluorene and bifluorene suggests an enhancement of the bifluorene TPA due to coupling effects between monomers. In nonlinear transmission measurements, two-photon absorption is reinforced by the excited-state absorption that occurs during the pulse duration. At resonance, the three-photon absorption coefficient is $\alpha$3 = 14 000 cm3/GW2 for a bifluorene concentration of 600 g/L. This strong nonlinear absorption leads to an efficient optical power limiting in the green and blue parts of the spectrum. The maximum transmitted energy is lower than 10 $\mu$J for an input energy of up to 200 $\mu$J in a F/5 optical geometry.},

The absolute Raman excitation profiles and absorption spectra are simulated using time-dependent wave packet propagation techniques to determine the excited-state geometry changes along the five or six principal Raman-active vibrations as well as estimates of the solvent reorganization energies. The total vibrational reorganization energy decreases and the solvent reorganization energy increases with increasing solvent polarity in all solvents except methanol, where specific hydrogen-bonding interactions may be important. The dimensionless normal coordinate geometry changes obtained from the resonance Raman analysis are converted to actual bond length and bond angle changes with the aid of normal mode coefficients from a ground-state density functional theory calculation. The geometry changes upon electronic excitation involve predominantly the Cphenyl-Nnitro, N-O, and phenyl C2-C3 bond lengths, with little involvement of the amino group. Nonresonant Raman spectra in 1,4-dioxane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, and methanol show only a very small solvent dependence of the vibrational frequencies. This suggests that changing the solvent affects the excited state more than the ground state, calling into question two-state models that treat the ground and charge-transfer excited states as linear combinations of neutral and zwitterionic basis states with solvent dependent coefficients.},

  abstract = {A real-space method is developed to calculate molecular hyperpolarizabilities in the time-dependent density functional theory. The method is based on the response function formalism which was developed by Senatore and Subbaswamy for the third harmonic generation of rare-gas atoms [Phys. Rev. A 35, 2440 (1987)]. The response equations are discretized in real space employing a uniform grid representation in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate, and are solved with iterative methods such as conjugate-gradient and conjugate-residual methods. The method works efficiently for both small and large molecules, and for any nonlinear optical processes up to third order. The spatial convergence of the calculation can be examined with two intuitive parameters, the grid spacing and the spatial box size. Applications of our method are presented for rare-gas atoms and molecules, N2, H2O, C2H4, C6H6, and C60. Our results agree well with other calculations employing basis functions except for a slight deviation in a large molecule, C60.},

  abstract = {The absorption spectra of Ag5-8 have been determined in the framework of the linear response equation-of-motion coupled cluster method and related techniques employing 11-electron relativistic effective core potential. In these treatments electron correlation effects for 11 electrons per atom are included, providing an accurate description of excited states of silver clusters. The calculations of transition energies and oscillator strengths have been carried out in a large energy interval for the stable structures and for the isomeric forms higher in energy. This allowed us to investigate the influence of structural properties on the spectroscopic patterns and to determine the role of d-electrons. Inclusion of d-electrons in the correlation treatment is mandatory to obtain accurate values for transition energies, but the excitations of s-electrons are primarily responsible for the spectroscopic patterns. They are characterized by the interference phenomena known in molecular spectroscopy which lead to a small number of intense and a large number of weak resonances. The calculated absorption spectra for the stable structures provide accurate predictions of the optical response properties in the gas phase and at the zero temperature. Since for neutral silver clusters the experimental data in the gas phase are not yet available, we also calculated spectra for deformed structures which model the influence of the environment such as rare-gas atoms, solid Ar-matrix or He-droplet. Comparison of our results with available experimental data permits us to identify structural properties responsible for the recorded spectral features.},

  abstract = {We have developed and investigated a dipole interaction model for calculating the polarizability of molecular clusters. The model has been parametrized from the frequency-dependent molecular polarizability as obtained from quantum chemical calculations for a series of 184 aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic compounds. A damping of the interatomic interaction at short distances is introduced in such a way as to retain a traceless interaction tensor and a good description of the damping over a wide range of interatomic distances. By adopting atomic polarizabilities in addition to atom-type parameters describing the damping and the frequency dependence, respectively, the model is found to reproduce the molecular frequency-dependent polarizability tensor calculated with ab initio methods. A study of the polarizability of four dimers has been carried out: the hydrogen fluoride, methane, benzene, and urea dimers. We find in general good agreement between the model and the quantum chemical results over a wide range of intermolecular distances. To demonstrate the power of the model, the polarizability has been calculated for a linear chain of urea molecules with up to 300 molecules and one- and two-dimensional clusters of C-60 with up to 25 molecules. Substantial intermolecular contributions are found for the polarizability anisotropy, whereas the effects are small for the mean polarizability. For the mean polarizability of C-60, we find good agreement between the model and experiments both in the case of an isolated molecule and in a comparison of a planar cluster of 25 C-60 molecules with experimental results on thin films.},

The geometries and vibrational frequencies of the ground and excited states are utilized to compute Franck-Condon factors. Calculated vibronic spectra for the transitions from the ground state to these five excited states are in agreement with experiment at 52 500-60 000 cm−1, with major contributions from the (1 1A″)\textleftarrowmath(1 1A′) and math(2  1A′)\textleftarrowmath(1  1A′) transitions. In this study, two spin-forbidden transitions of math(1  3A″)\textleftarrowmath(1 1A′) and math(2  3A″)\textleftarrowmath(1 1A′) are calculated to locate in 45 000-54 000 cm−1, and could be responsible for the observed one-photon absorption spectrum due to an intensity borrowing caused by the spin-orbit coupling of the Cl atom. Based on calculation, we speculate that upon the excitation of vinyl chloride at 193 nm the math(1  3A″) or math(2  3A″) excited state, instead of the ($\pi$,$\pi$∗), is initially prepared prior to the subsequent photodissociation processes.},

Efficient noniterative methods to calculate dynamic hyperpolarizability tensors of molecules for arbitrary frequency combinations are presented. With the introduced methods, hyperpolarizabilities of benzene and stilbene derivatives are investigated. The results show that the influence of substituents on the frequency-dependent hyperpolarizability is well described by time-dependent density-functional theory at the adiabatic local density level.

We adopt a direct algorithm for the calculation of the polarization response of the solvent subsystem. The strategy facilitates the calculation of the energy of the system and of the forces with respect to the solute coordinates and the solvent coordinates, including for excited states. This capability opens the way to the determination of optimized, transition structures, force constants, and intrinsic reaction pathways for the solute-solvent system, and to molecular dynamics calculations to account for finite temperature effects. As an illustration we characterize the structure and energy of micro-solvated formaldehyde H2CO in its ground state and in its 1(pi*<--n) excited state. A novel perpendicular structure is found to be the lowest energy conformation of the H2CO1(pi*<--n):H2O complex. The all-quantum-chemical results and the mixed Hamiltonian results, with or without solvent polarizability, are in semiquantitative agreement. We comment on the choice of Lennard-Jones parameters associated with a solute excited state. Lennard-Jones parameters that yield good ground state structures and energies with the mixed Hamiltonian model, are found to be too soft for the micro-solvated excited state H2CO in the adiabatic (equilibrium micro-solvation) regime.},

Based on a fully variational expression for the excited state energy, a compact derivation of first order properties is given. We report an implementation of analytic excited state gradients and charge moments for local, gradient corrected, and hybrid functionals, as well as for the configuration interaction singles (CIS) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) methods. By exploiting analogies to ground state energy and gradient calculations, efficient techniques can be transferred to excited state methods. Benchmark results demonstrate that, for low-lying excited states, geometry optimizations are not substantially more expensive than for the ground state, independent of the molecular size. We assess the quality of calculated adiabatic excitation energies, structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies by comparison with accurate experimental data for a variety of excited states and molecules. Similar trends are observed for adiabatic excitation energies as for vertical ones. TDDFT is more robust than CIS and TDHF, in particular, for geometries differing significantly from the ground state minimum. The TDDFT excited state structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies are of a remarkably high quality, which is comparable to that obtained in ground state density functional calculations. Thus, yielding considerably more accurate results at similar computational cost, TDDFT rivals CIS as a standard method for calculating excited state properties in larger molecules.},

While this is the first systematic study of coupled-cluster (CC) Raman intensities considering also the dispersion effect for molecules with more than two atoms, another purpose of this study is the analysis of the accuracy of density functional Raman activities with respect to those from highly correlated ab initio methods in order to evaluate the validity of density functional theory for the calculation of Raman spectra for large molecules. The density functional intensities compare sufficiently well with those from ab initio methods. While the dynamic multiconfigurational intensities always compare well with the experimental values, they are usually smaller than those from density functional and coupled-cluster theories. The Raman intensities obtained from static coupled-cluster calculations are in better agreement with experiment than those from dynamic calculations, which should yield improved results as the dispersion effect is taken into account. Furthermore, Raman intensities obtained from the CC2 model are compared to those from CCSD calculations. It is found that the CC2 Raman activities deviate from the CCSD reference data. Particularly for the coupled-cluster Raman intensities the widely used Sadlej basis set leads to results which can be significantly improved on by using larger basis sets.},

The solvent molecules are modeled by point charges representing the permanent electronic charge distribution, and distributed polarizabilities for describing the solvent polarization arising from many-body interactions. The QM/MM interactions are introduced into the Kohn-Sham equations, thereby allowing for the solute to be polarized by the solvent and vice versa. Here we present some initial results for water in aqueous solution. It is found that the inclusion of solvent polarization is essential for an accurate description of dipole and quadrupole moments in the liquid phase. We find a very good agreement between the liquid phase dipole and quadrupole moments obtained using the Local Density Approximation and results obtained with a similar model at the Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles level of theory using the same water cluster structure. The influence of basis set and exchange correlation functional on the liquid phase properties was investigated and indicates that for an accurate description of the liquid phase properties using DFT a good description of the gas phase dipole moment and molecular polarizability are also needed.},

  abstract = {The binding interactions between the pyridine and small coinage metal clusters such as copper, silver and gold in different sizes (n = 2-4) have been investigated by a density function theory approach. We obtain the binding energies of these pyridine-metal cluster complexes and analyze the nature of the binding interactions in terms of the metal cluster-dependent molecular orbital properties and binding orientations. The calculated binding energies show a good agreement with the experimental values of the pyridine adsorbed on the metal surfaces. We find that the order in the binding energies between pyridine and then metals clusters is Cu-Au>Ag and the interaction between pyridine and the silver is the weakest among these three metals. The donation of the lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of the pyridine molecule is the major contribution to the binding interaction between pyridine and each metal cluster. The back-donation interaction from the metal atoms to the pi-type anti-bonding orbital is very weak in all these complexes. The time-dependent density functional theory has also been performed to provide information on the relative energies of the low-lying states of each complex with respect to its ground state. In particular, we have explored the excited charge-transfer states, which play an important role in surface-enhanced Raman scattering processes. Based on the calculated molecular properties, we discuss Raman spectroscopy of pyridine adsorbed on rough metal surfaces.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer) electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an important role in explaining measured lifetimes.},

  abstract = {An extensive study of fundamental frequencies and anharmonic vibrational constants for polyatomic molecules obtained from Becke three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) and Becke-Perdew (BP86) density functional calculations is presented. These calculations are based on standard perturbation theory, and are compared to correlation-corrected vibrational self-consistent field (CC-VSCF) calculations for the water dimer. The anharmonic corrections obtained from density-functional calculations compare well with experimental values and with results from correlated ab initio methods. While fundamental frequencies from B3LYP calculations are reliable, they are considerably too small for BP86 calculations. Consequently, the good agreement of unscaled harmonic frequencies from BP86 calculations with experimental frequencies is due to an error cancellation effect. This is of importance for the prediction of vibrational spectra for large molecules, because the perturbation theory approach naturally becomes unreliable for very large molecules due to the increasing number of anharmonic resonance effects. These resonances seriously limit the applicability of perturbation theoretical approaches to anharmonic vibrational constants, whereas the computational effort for the calculation of cubic and quartic force constants, is feasible because calculations can be performed very efficiently by a parallelized calculation of harmonic force constants for several structures, which are distorted along the normal coordinates, followed by numerical differentiation.},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.},

  abstract = {The linear absorption spectra, resonance Raman excitation profiles and depolarization dispersion curves, and hyper-Rayleigh scattering profiles are calculated for excitonically coupled homodimers of a model electron donor-acceptor ``push-pull'' conjugated chromophore as a function of dimer geometry. The vibronic eigenstates of the dimer are calculated by diagonalizing the matrix of transition dipole couplings among the vibronic transitions of the constituent monomers. The absorption spectra show the usual red- or blueshifted transitions for J-type or H-type dimers, respectively. When the electronic coupling is large compared with the vibronic width of the monomer spectrum, the dimer absorption spectra exhibit simple Franck-Condon progressions having reduced vibronic intensities compared with the monomer, and the resonance Raman excitation profiles are shifted but otherwise only weakly perturbed. When the coupling is comparable to the vibronic width, the H-dimer absorption spectra exhibit irregular vibronic frequency spacings and intensity patterns and the effects on the Raman excitation profiles are larger. There is strong dispersion in the Raman depolarization ratios for dimer geometries in which both transitions carry oscillator strength. The first hyperpolarizabilities are somewhat enhanced in J-dimers and considerably reduced in H-dimers. These effects on the molecular beta will amplify the effects of dimerization on the ground-state dipole moment in electro-optic materials formed from chromophore-doped polymers that must be electric field poled to obtain the net alignment needed for a macroscopic chi^(2).},

  abstract = {A discrete solvent reaction field model for calculating frequency-dependent molecular linear response properties of molecules in solution is presented. The model combines a time-dependent density functional theory (QM) description of the solute molecule with a classical (MM) description of the discrete solvent molecules. The classical solvent molecules are represented using distributed atomic charges and polarizabilities. All the atomic parameters have been chosen so as to describe molecular gas phase properties of the solvent molecule, i.e., the atomic charges reproduce the molecular dipole moment and the atomic polarizabilities reproduce the molecular polarizability tensor using a modified dipole interaction model. The QM/MM interactions are introduced into the Kohn-Sham equations and all interactions are solved self-consistently, thereby allowing for the solute to be polarized by the solvent. Furthermore, the inclusion of polarizabilities in the MM part allows for the solvent molecules to be polarized by the solute and by interactions with other solvent molecules. Initial applications of the model to calculate the vertical electronic excitation energies and frequency-dependent molecular polarizability of a water molecule in a cluster of 127 classical water molecules are presented. The effect of using different exchange correlation (xc)-potentials is investigated and the results are compared with results from wave function methods combined with a similar solvent model both at the correlated and uncorrelated level of theory. It is shown that accurate results in agreement with correlated wave function results can be obtained using xc-potentials with the correct asymptotic behavior.},

Whereas the order of magnitude of the enhancement can be understood from electromagnetic field enhancement the unusual line shape remains without satisfactory explanation. An interaction with electron-hole pairs would lead to an asymmetric line but this should be restricted to the first monolayer. However, asymmetry is also observed for vibrations at larger distances from the metal-film surface. Here we show strongly asymmetric lines and their enhancement as a consequence of the interaction of adsorbate vibrations with surface plasmons of metal islands. Both the effects and also the baseline change can be estimated by a proper application of well established effective-media models.},

A comparison of calculated energies with experiment shows that the OVGF method gives accurate results for a broad energy range of 8-11.5 eV. The deviations from experimental data are as low as 0.03-0.04 eV for n = 5-8 and are slightly larger for the higher states, ∼0.05 eV for n = 9-11. The OVGF calculations are thus demonstrated to be able to reproduce excitation energies for high-lying Rydberg states with a good precision, higher than that provided by the EOM-CCSD method, if one uses experimental or high-level calculated values of the ionization potential. With an increase of the principal quantum number for the Rydberg state, the OVGF corrections to the HF-calculated energies decrease and one can use the HF approach to compute orbital energy levels and excitation energies for higher Rydberg states. The energy levels for high-lying Rydberg states are shown to be insensitive to the molecular geometry, so that the energy gaps between vertical absorption and vertical emission for these states should be similar and can be estimated by the relaxation energy of the neutral system starting from geometry of the positive ion.},

  abstract = {A recently introduced formulation of time dependent linear response density functional theory within the plane-wave pseudopotential framework [J. Hutter, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 3928 (2003)] is applied to the study of solvent shift and intensity enhancement effects of the 1A2 n\textrightarrow$\pi$∗ electronic transition in acetone, treating solute and solvent at the same level of theory. We propose a suitable formalism for computing transition intensities based on the modern theory of polarization, which is applicable to condensed-phase and finite systems alike. The gain in intensity brought about by thermal fluctuations is studied in molecular acetone at room temperature, and in gas-phase (CH3)2CO⋅(H2O)2 at 25 K. The latter system is characterized by the appearance of relatively intense features in the low-energy region of the spectrum, attributable to spurious solvent\textrightarrowsolute charge-transfer excitations created by deficiencies in the DFT methodology. The n\textrightarrow$\pi$∗ transition can be partially isolated from the charge-transfer bands, yielding a blueshift of 0.17 eV with respect to gas-phase acetone. This analysis is then carried over to a solution of acetone in water, where further complications are encountered in the from of a solute\textrightarrowsolvent charge transfer excitations overlapping with the n\textrightarrow$\pi$∗ band. The optically active occupied states are found to be largely localized on either solute or solvent, and using this feature we were again able to isolate the physical n\textrightarrow$\pi$∗ band and compute the solvatochromic shift. The result of 0.19 eV is in good agreement with experiment, as is the general increase in the mean oscillator strength of the transition. The unphysical charge transfers are interpreted in terms of degeneracies in the spectrum of orbital energies of the aqueous acetone solution.},

The results are used to determine what conditions are most favorable for producing enhancements large enough to observe single molecule surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Most of the calculations refer to triangular prisms, which exhibit distinct dipole and quadrupole resonances that can easily be controlled by varying particle size. In addition, for the dimer calculations we study the influence of dimer separation and orientation, especially for dimers that are separated by a few nanometers. We find that the largest |E|2 values for dimers are about a factor of 10 larger than those for all the monomers examined. For all particles and particle orientations, the plasmon resonances which lead to the largest E-fields are those with the longest wavelength dipolar excitation. The spacing of the particles in the dimer plays a crucial role, and we find that the spacing needed to achieve a given |E|2 is proportional to nanoparticle size for particles below 100 nm in size. Particle shape and curvature are of lesser importance, with a head to tail configuration of two triangles giving enhanced fields comparable to head to head, or rounded head to tail. The largest |E|2 values we have calculated for spacings of 2 nm or more is $\sim$105.},

  abstract = {Calculations of the vibronic structure in electronic spectra of large organic molecules based on density functional methods are presented. The geometries of the excited states are obtained from time-dependent density functional (TDDFT) calculations employing the B3LYP hybrid functional. The vibrational functions and transition dipole moment derivatives are calculated within the harmonic approximation by finite difference of analytical gradients and the transition dipole moment, respectively. Normal mode mixing is taken into account by the Duschinsky transformation. The vibronic structure of strongly dipole-allowed transitions is calculated within the Franck-Condon approximation. Weakly dipole-allowed and dipole-forbidden transitions are treated within the Franck-Condon-Herzberg-Teller and Herzberg-Teller approximation, respectively. The absorption spectra of several organic $\pi$ systems (anthracene, pentacene, pyrene, octatetraene, styrene, azulene, phenoxyl) are calculated and compared with experimental data. For dipole-allowed transitions in general a very good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained. This indicates the good quality of the optimized geometries and harmonic force fields. Larger errors are found for the weakly dipole-allowed S0\textrightarrowS1 transition of pyrene which can tentatively be assigned to TDDFT errors for the relative energies of excited states close to the target state. The weak bands of azulene and phenoxyl are very well described within the Franck-Condon approximation which can be explained by the large energy gap (>1.2 eV) to higher-lying excited states leading to small vibronic couplings. Once corrections are made for the errors in the theoretical 0-0 transition energies, the TDDFT approach to calculate vibronic structure seems to outperform both widely used ab initio methods based on configuration interaction singles or complete active space self-consistent field wave functions and semiempirical treatments regarding accuracy, applicability, and computational effort. Together with the parallel computer implementations employed, the present approach appears to be a valuable tool for a quantitative description and detailed understanding of electronic excitation processes in large molecules.},

  abstract = {In this work we illustrate an extension of the polarizable continuum model to describe solvation effects on molecules at the interface between two fluid phases (liquid/liquid, liquid/vapor). This extension goes beyond the naive picture of the interface as a plane dividing two distinct dielectrics, commonly employed in continuum models. The main feature of the model is the use of a diffuse interface with an electric permittivity depending on the position. This characteristic clearly allows the study of simple interfaces as well as more complex membrane or multilayer structures. Moreover the smooth variation of the permittivity in the diffuse interface, in contrast to the sharp boundary between two regions, overcomes the numerical divergences due to charges placed at the boundary. The implementation of the model relies on the integral equation formalism, which allows one to calculate the reaction field acting on a molecule immersed in a dielectric environment once the proper Green's function is known. In the present case, such a Green's function is obtained numerically, allowing a large flexibility in the choice of the dielectric permittivity profile. The applications have been selected with the aim of illustrating the capabilities of the model; its present limitations are also discussed.},

Thus, hybrids can be constructed which neglect the computationally demanding long-range part of HF exchange while still retaining the superior accuracy of hybrid functionals, compared to pure density functionals.},

  abstract = {We apply the long-range correction (LC) scheme for exchange functionals of density functional theory to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and examine its efficiency in dealing with the serious problems of TDDFT, i.e., the underestimations of Rydberg excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and charge-transfer excitation energies. By calculating vertical excitation energies of typical molecules, it was found that LC-TDDFT gives accurate excitation energies, within an error of 0.5 eV, and reasonable oscillator strengths, while TDDFT employing a pure functional provides 1.5 eV lower excitation energies and two orders of magnitude lower oscillator strengths for the Rydberg excitations. It was also found that LC-TDDFT clearly reproduces the correct asymptotic behavior of the charge-transfer excitation energy of ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene dimer for the long intramolecular distance, unlike a conventional far-nucleus asymptotic correction scheme. It is, therefore, presumed that poor TDDFT results for pure functionals may be due to their lack of a long-range orbital-orbital interaction.},

We find that the thiolate is energetically more stable than the thiol, however the process of detachment of H from the thiol appears to be possibly mediated by the intermediate step of H chemisorption on Au. Cleavage of the S-H bond is accompanied by a 90deg rotation of the molecule around the S-Au bond, showing a strong steric specificity. Such a rotation is induced by the relative energy shift of the S atom p orbitals with respect to the benzene pi ring and the Au d orbitals. By analyzing the correlation of the bond energy, bond lengths, and HOMO-LUMO gap with the number of S-Au bonds, we find that the thiolate S atom appears to prefer a low-coordination condition on Au clusters.},

The transform theory of resonance Raman scattering is based on Kramers-Kronig relations between polarizability tensor components and the optical absorption. Stationary points for the two lowest excited singlet states of uracil are optimized and characterized by means of numerical differentiation of analytical excited-state gradients. It is shown that the effect of electron correlation leads to substantial modifications of the relative intensities. Calculations of vibrational frequencies for ground and excited states are carried out, which show that the neglect of Duschinsky mixing and the assumption of equal wave numbers for ground and excited state are not in all cases good approximations. We also compare the transform-theory resonance Raman intensities with those obtained within a simple approximation from excited-state gradients at the ground-state equilibrium position, and find that they are in qualitative agreement in the case of CIS, but show some important differences in calculations based on density functional theory. Since the results from CIS calculations are in better agreement with experiment, we also present approximate resonance Raman spectra obtained using excited-state gradients from multireference perturbation theory calculations, which confirm the CIS gradients.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of charge-transfer excitation energies omegaCT are significantly in error when the adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) is employed for the exchange-correlation kernel fxc. We relate the error to the physical meaning of the orbital energy of the Kohn-Sham lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The LUMO orbital energy in Kohn-Sham DFT; in contrast to the Hartree-Fock model approximates an excited electron, which is correct for excitations in compact molecules. In CT transitions the energy of the LUMO of the acceptor molecule should instead describe an added electron, i.e., approximate the electron affinity. To obtain a contribution that compensates for the difference, a specific divergence of fxc is required in rigorous TDDFT, and a suitable asymptotically correct form of the kernel f<sub>xc</sub><sup>asymp</sup> is proposed. The importance of the asymptotic correction of fxc is demonstrated with the calculation of omegaCT(R) for the prototype diatomic system HeBe at various separations R(He-Be). The TDDFT-ALDA curve omegaCT(R) roughly resembles the benchmark ab initio curve omega<sub>CT</sub><sup>CISD</sup>(R) of a configuration interaction calculation with single and double excitations in the region R = 1-1.5 {\AA}, where a sizable He-Be interaction exists, but exhibits the wrong behavior omegaCT(R)<<omega<sub>CT</sub><sup>CISD</sup>(R) at large R. The TDDFT curve obtained with f<sub>xc</sub><sup>asymp</sup> however approaches omega<sub>CT</sub><sup>CISD</sup>(R) closely in the region R = 3-10 {\AA}. Then, the adequate rigorous TDDFT approach should interpolate between the LDA/GGA ALDA xc kernel for excitations in compact systems and f<sub>xc</sub><sup>asymp</sup> for weakly interacting fragments and suitable interpolation expressions are considered.},

This response function is conventionally calculated quantum-mechanically, but the challenges in applying quantum mechanics to large, anharmonic systems motivate the examination of classical mechanical vibrational nonlinear response functions. We present an approximate formulation of the classical mechanical third-order vibrational response function for an anharmonic solute oscillator interacting with a harmonic solvent, which establishes a clear connection between classical and quantum mechanical treatments. This formalism permits the identification of the classical mechanical analog of the pure dephasing of a quantum mechanical degree of freedom, and suggests the construction of classical mechanical analogs of the double-sided Feynman diagrams of quantum mechanics, which are widely applied to nonlinear spectroscopy. Application of a rotating wave approximation permits the analytic extraction of signals obeying particular spatial phase matching conditions from a classical-mechanical response function. Calculations of the third-order response function for an anharmonic oscillator coupled to a harmonic solvent are compared to numerically correct classical mechanical results.},

The molecule is treated quantum mechanically at Hartree-Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle) a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD--time dependent). The radiative decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition, the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule close to silver aggregates of complex shape.},

As in our previous study of betaine-30 in acetonitrile, the solvent reorganization energy for the excited electronic state, determined from resonance Raman spectroscopy, was found to be smaller than that for the ground electronic state, determined from the absorption spectrum. The mode-dependent internal reorganization energies of betaine-30 in ethanol were found to be slightly larger than those of betaine-30 in acetonitrile. Temperature-dependent solvent reorganization energies for the ground electronic state were determined from analysis of the absorption line shape from 279 to 332 K and were found to decrease with increasing temperature. The influence of hydrogen bonding on the solvent and internal reorganization energy of betaine-30 is considered, and the physical basis for nonlinear solvent response is discussed.},

  abstract = {A polarizable quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics model has been extended to account for the difference between the macroscopic electric field and the actual electric field felt by the solute molecule. This enables the calculation of effective microscopic properties which can be related to macroscopic susceptibilities directly comparable with experimental results. By seperating the discrete local field into two distinct contribution we define two different microscopic properties, the so-called solute and effective properties. The solute properties account for the pure solvent effects, i.e., effects even when the macroscopic electric field is zero, and the effective properties account for both the pure solvent effects and the effect from the induced dipoles in the solvent due to the macroscopic electric field. We present results for the linear and nonlinear polarizabilities of water and acetonitrile both in the gas phase and in the liquid phase. For all the properties we find that the pure solvent effect increases the properties whereas the induced electric field decreases the properties. Furthermore, we present results for the refractive index, third-harmonic generation (THG), and electric field induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) for liquid water and acetonitrile. We find in general good agreement between the calculated and experimental results for the refractive index and the THG susceptibility. For the EFISH susceptibility, however, the difference between experiment and theory is larger since the orientational effect arising from the static electric field is not accurately described.},

In combination with nonhybrid functionals, the RI-J approximation leads to speed ups in total timings of an order of magnitude compared to the conventional method; this is demonstrated for oligothiophenes with up to 40 monomeric units and adamantane clusters. We assess the accuracy of the computed adiabatic excitation energies, excited state structures, and vibrational frequencies on a set of 36 excited states. The error introduced by the RI-J approximation is found to be negligible compared to deficiencies of standard basis sets and functionals. Auxiliary basis sets optimized for ground states are suitable for excited state calculations with small modifications.

  abstract = {We investigate the usefulness of a frozen-density embedding scheme within density-functional theory [ J. Phys. Chem. 97, 8050 (1993) ] for the calculation of solvatochromic shifts. The frozen-density calculations, particularly of excitation energies have two clear advantages over the standard supermolecule calculations: (i) calculations for much larger systems are feasible, since the time-consuming time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) part is carried out in a limited molecular orbital space, while the effect of the surroundings is still included at a quantum mechanical level. This allows a large number of solvent molecules to be included and thus affords both specific and nonspecific solvent effects to be modeled. (ii) Only excitations of the system of interest, i.e., the selected embedded system, are calculated. This allows an easy analysis and interpretation of the results. In TDDFT calculations, it avoids unphysical results introduced by spurious mixings with the artificially too low charge-transfer excitations which are an artifact of the adiabatic local-density approximation or generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation kernels currently used. The performance of the frozen-density embedding method is tested for the well-studied solvatochromic properties of the n\textrightarrow$\pi$* excitation of acetone. Further enhancement of the efficiency is studied by constructing approximate solvent densities, e.g., from a superposition of densities of individual solvent molecules. This is demonstrated for systems with up to 802 atoms. To obtain a realistic modeling of the absorption spectra of solvated molecules, including the effect of the solvent motions, we combine the embedding scheme with classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Car-Parrinello MD simulations to obtain snapshots of the solute and its solvent environment, for which then excitation energies are calculated. The frozen-density embedding yields estimated solvent shifts in the range of 0.20-0.26 eV, in good agreement with experimental values of between 0.19 and 0.21 eV.},

  abstract = {Resonance Raman and resonance hyper-Raman spectra of the ``push-pull'' conjugated molecule 1-(4′-dihexylaminostyryl)-4-(4″-nitrostyryl)benzene in acetone have been measured at excitation wavelengths from 485 to 356 nm (two-photon wavelengths for the nonlinear spectra), resonant with the first two bands in the linear absorption spectrum. The theory of resonance hyper-Raman scattering intensities is developed and simplified using assumptions appropriate for intramolecular charge-transfer transitions of large molecules in solution. The absorption spectrum and the Raman, hyper-Rayleigh, and hyper-Raman excitation profiles, all in absolute intensity units, are quantitatively simulated to probe the structures and the one- and two-photon transition strengths of the two lowest-energy allowed electronic transitions. All four spectroscopic observables are reasonably well reproduced with a single set of excited-state parameters. The two lowest-energy, one-photon allowed electronic transitions have fairly comparable one-photon and two-photon transition strengths, but the higher-energy transition is largely localized on the nitrophenyl group while the lower-energy transition is more delocalized.},

  abstract = {We present an implementation for considering finite lifetime of the electronic excited states into linear-response theory within time-dependent density-functional theory. The lifetime of the excited states is introduced by a common phenomenological damping factor. The real and imaginary frequency-dependent polarizabilities can thus be calculated over a broad range of frequencies. This allows for the study of linear-response properties both in the resonance and nonresonance cases. The method is complementary to the standard approach of calculating the excitation energies from the poles of the polarizability. The real and imaginary polarizabilities can then be calculated in any specific energy range of interest, in contrast to the excitation energies which are usually solved only for the lowest electronic states. We have verified the method by investigating the photoabsorption properties of small alkali clusters. For these systems, we have calculated the real and imaginary polarizabilities in the energy range of 1-4 eV and compared these with excitation energy calculations. The results showed good agreement with both previous theoretical and experimental results.},

We discuss how exact TDDFT captures charge transfer between open-shell species: in particular, the role of the step in the ground-state potential, and the severe frequency dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel. An expression for the latter is derived, that becomes exact in the limit that the charge-transfer excitations are well separated from other excitations. The exchange-correlation kernel has the task of undoing the static correlation in the ground state introduced by the step, in order to accurately recover the physical charge-transfer states.},

  abstract = {We have constructed a group of classical potentials based on ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to describe the chemical bonding between benzenedithiolate (BDT) molecule and gold atoms, including bond stretching, bond angle bending, and dihedral angle torsion involved at the interface between the molecule and gold clusters. Three DFT functionals, local-density approximation (LDA), PBE0, and X3LYP, have been implemented to calculate single point energies (SPE) for a large number of molecular configurations of BDT-1, 2 Au complexes. The three DFT methods yield similar bonding curves. The variations of atomic charges from Mulliken population analysis within the molecule/metal complex versus different molecular configurations have been investigated in detail. We found that, except for bonded atoms in BDT-1, 2 Au complexes, the Mulliken partial charges of other atoms in BDT are quite stable, which significantly reduces the uncertainty in partial charge selections in classical molecular simulations. Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the structure of BDT self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and the adsorption geometry of S adatoms on Au (111) surface. We found that the bond-stretching potential is the most dominant part in chemical bonding. Whereas the local bonding geometry of BDT molecular configuration may depend on the DFT functional used, the global packing structure of BDT SAM is quite independent of DFT functional, even though the uncertainty of some force-field parameters for chemical bonding can be as large as $\sim$100%. This indicates that the intermolecular interactions play a dominant role in determining the BDT SAMs global packing structure.},

The particular model adopted is the recently developed discrete solvent reaction field (DRF) model. The DRF model is a polarizable QM/MM model in which the QM part is treated using time-dependent density-functional theory and local-field effects are incorporated. This allows for direct computation of molecular effective properties which can be compared with experimental results. The solvation shift for the first hyperpolarizability is calculated to be 30% which is in good agreement with the experimental results. However, the calculated values, both in the gas phase and in solution, are by a factor of 2 larger than the experimental ones. This is in contrast to the calculation of the first hyperpolarizability for several small molecules in the gas phase where fair agreement is found with experimental. The inclusion of local-field effects in the calculations was found to be crucial and neglecting them led to results which are significantly larger. To test the DRF model the refractive index of liquid 1,4-dioxane was also calculated and found to be in good agreement with experiment.},

We have carried out the dynamics on a basic four-mode model of pyrazine with the inclusion of five major modes as well as the rest of the vibrational modes as bath modes. Investigations reveal the effect of bath modes such as energy and population transfer from the subsystem to the bath. Calculated results demonstrate excellent agreement with traditional quantum-mechanical findings during the entire propagation and converge to the exact quantum results when enough gridpoints are used.

  abstract = {In a recent article [R. Cammi, S. Corni, B. Mennucci, and J. Tomasi, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 104513 (2005)], we demonstrated that the state-specific (SS) and the linear-response (LR) approaches, two different ways to calculate solute excitation energies in the framework of quantum-mechanical continuum models of solvation, give different excitation energy expressions. In particular, they differ in the terms related to the electronic response of the solvent. In the present work, we further investigate this difference by comparing the excitation energy expressions of SS and LR with those obtained through a simple model for solute-solvent systems that bypasses one of the basic assumptions of continuum solvation models, i.e., the use of a single Hartree product of a solute and a solvent wave function to describe the total solute-solvent wave function. In particular, we consider the total solute-solvent wave function as a linear combination of the four products of two solute states and two solvent electronic states. To maximize the comparability with quantum-mechanical continuum model the resulting excitation energy expression is recast in terms of response functions of the solvent and quantities proper for the solvated molecule. The comparison of the presented expressions with the LR and SS ones enlightens the physical meaning of the terms included or neglected by these approaches and shows that SS agrees with the results of the four-level model, while LR includes a term classified as dispersion in previous treatments and neglects another related to electrostatic. A discussion on the possible origin of the LR flaw is finally given.},

  abstract = {We present a method to calculate both normal Raman-scattering (NRS) and resonance Raman-scattering (RRS) spectra from the geometrical derivatives of the frequency-dependent polarizability. In the RRS case, the polarizability derivatives are calculated from resonance polarizabilities by including a finite lifetime of the electronic excited states using time-dependent density-functional theory. The method is a short-time approximation to the Kramers, Heisenberg, and Dirac formalism. It is similar to the simple excited-state gradient approximation method if only one electronic excited state is important, however, it is not restricted to only one electronic excited state. Since the method can be applied to both NRS and RRS, it can be used we present the results for the S-2 state of uracil and the S-4, S-3, and S-2 states of pyrene. As expected, the results are almost identical to the results obtained from the excited-state gradient approximation method. Comparing with the experimental results, we find in general quite good agreement which enables an assignment of the experimental bands to bands in the calculated spectrum. For uracil the inclusion of explicit waters in the calculations was found to be necessary to match the solution spectra. The calculated resonance enhancements are on the order of 10(4) - 10(6), which is in agreement with experimental findings. For pyrene the method is also able to distinguish between the three different electronic states for which experimental data are available. The neglect of anharmonicity and solvent effects in the calculations leads to some discrepancy between theory and experiment.},

Electronic interactions between the sigma orbitals of the substituent and the pi orbitals of the ring are found to enhance the Raman activities, depending on the substituent and its conformation. In the case of tert-butylbenzene [C6H5C(CH3)3] and trimethylphenylsilane [C6H5Si(CH3)3], three single bonds which are linked to the alpha atom of the substituent have low rotational barriers around the joint bond. Nearly free rotation of the substituents leads to a significant probability for one of the single bonds to occupy a conformation close to the vertical configuration with respect to the ring at room temperature. The resultant sigma-pi electronic interaction gives rise to the large Raman activities. In contrast, those possessing a single bond in a coplanar (or nearly coplanar) configuration at the most stable equilibrium state, i.e., anisole (C6H5OCH3), thioanisole (C6H5SCH3), and N-methylaniline (C6H5NHCH3), display no prominent Raman bands for the low-frequency vibrational modes. In these molecules, the sigma-pi conjugation does not take place due to the orthogonal orientation of the orbitals. Strong conformational dependence of the sigma-pi Raman enhancement is clearly obtained for the metastable vertical conformer of thioanisole, for which Raman activities are one-order magnitude greater than those of the coplanar conformer.},

  abstract = {In this paper a novel approach to study the formation and relaxation of excited states in solution is presented within the integral equation formalism version of the polarizable continuum model. Such an approach uses the excited state relaxed density matrix to correct the time dependent density functional theory excitation energies and it introduces a state-specific solvent response, which can be further generalized within a time dependent formalism. This generalization is based on the use of a complex dielectric permittivity as a function of the frequency, (). The approach is here presented in its theoretical formulation and applied to the various steps involved in the formation and relaxation of electronic excited states in solvated molecules. In particular, vertical excitations (and emissions), as well as time dependent Stokes shift and complete relaxation from vertical excited states back to ground state, can be obtained as different applications of the same theory. Numerical results on two molecular systems are reported to better illustrate the features of the model.},

  abstract = {An analytical excitation energy gradient of long-range corrected time-dependent density functional theory (LC-TDDFT) is presented. This is based on a previous analytical TDDFT gradient formalism, which avoids solving the coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham equation for each nuclear degree of freedom. In LC-TDDFT, exchange interactions are evaluated by combining the short-range part of a DFT exchange functional with the long-range part of the Hartree-Fock exchange integral. This LC-TDDFT gradient was first examined by calculating the excited state geometries and adiabatic excitation energies of small typical molecules and a small protonated Schiff base. As a result, we found that long-range interactions play a significant role even in valence excited states of small systems. This analytical LC-TDDFT gradient was also applied to the investigations of small twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) systems. By comparing with calculated ab initio multireference perturbation theory and experimental results, we found that LC-TDDFT gave much more accurate absorption and fluorescence energies of these systems than those of conventional TDDFTs using pure and hybrid functionals. For optimized excited state geometries, LC-TDDFT provided fairly different twisting and wagging angles of these small TICT systems in comparison with conventional TDDFT results.},

  abstract = {We present a model for electromagnetic enhancements in surface enhanced Raman optical activity (SEROA) spectroscopy. The model extends previous treatments of SEROA to substrates, such as metal nanoparticles in solution, that are orientationally averaged with respect to the laboratory frame. Our theoretical treatment combines analytical expressions for unenhanced Raman optical activity with molecular polarizability tensors that are dressed by the substrate's electromagnetic enhancements. We evaluate enhancements from model substrates to determine preliminary scaling laws and selection rules for SEROA. We find that dipolar substrates enhance Raman optical activity (ROA) scattering less than Raman scattering. Evanescent gradient contributions to orientationally averaged ROA scale to first or higher orders in the gradient of the incident plane-wave field. These evanescent gradient contributions may be large for substrates with quadrupolar responses to the plane-wave field gradient. Some substrates may also show a ROA contribution that depends only on the molecular electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability. These conclusions are illus trated via numerical calculations of surface enhanced Raman and ROA spectra from (R)-(−)-bromochlorofluoromethane on various model substrates.},

  abstract = {Adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory fails for excitations of a heteroatomic molecule composed of two open-shell fragments at large separation. Strong frequency dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel is necessary for both local and charge-transfer excitations. The root of this is the static correlation created by the step in the exact Kohn-Sham ground-state potential between the two fragments. An approximate nonempirical kernel is derived for excited molecular dissociation curves at large separation. Our result is also relevant when the usual local and semilocal approximations are used for the ground-state potential, as static correlation there arises from the coalescence of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital energies as the molecule dissociates.},

The functional is designed to capture the main dependence of the exchange-correlation energy on local spin density, spin density gradient, and spin kinetic energy density, and it is parametrized to satisfy the uniform-electron-gas limit and to have good performance for both main-group chemistry and transition metal chemistry. The M06-L functional and 14 other functionals have been comparatively assessed against 22 energetic databases. Among the tested functionals, which include the popular B3LYP, BLYP, and BP86 functionals as well as our previous M05 functional, the M06-L functional gives the best overall performance for a combination of main-group thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and organometallic, inorganometallic, biological, and noncovalent interactions. It also does very well for predicting geometries and vibrational frequencies. Because of the computational advantages of local functionals, the present functional should be very useful for many applications in chemistry, especially for simulations on moderate-sized and large systems and when long time scales must be addressed.},

The investigation has been carried out with a realistic 24-mode model Hamiltonian consisting of all the vibrational degrees of freedom of pyrazine molecule. First, we perform the simulation on a basic four-mode model, and then by including additional eight important modes and finally, by introducing 20 bath modes on the basic model. This sequential inclusion of bath modes demonstrates the effect of weak modes on the subsystem, where the calculations of energy and population transfer from basic model to the bath quantify the same effect. The spectral profile obtained by using TDDVR approach shows reasonably good agreement with the results calculated by quantum mechanical approach. It appears that the TDDVR approach for those large systems where quantum mechanical description is needed in a restricted region is a good compromise between accuracy and speed.},

In previous work, the Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac framework was utilized to explain many of the observed features in SERS. However, recent experimental and theoretical developments suggest that we revise the theory to take advantage of the time-dependent picture of Raman scattering. Results are obtained for molecular adsorption on nanoparticles in both the strong confinement limit and the weak confinement limit. We show that the Herzberg-Teller contributions to the charge-transfer effect in SERS display a resonance at the molecule-to-metal or metal-to-molecule transition while retaining the selection rules associated with normal Raman spectroscopy (i.e., harmonic oscillator, as opposed to Franck-Condon overlaps). The charge-transfer contribution to the enhancement factor scales as $\Gamma$−4, where $\Gamma$ is the homogeneous linewidth of the charge-transfer transition, and thus is extremely sensitive to the magnitude of this parameter. We show that the Herzberg-Teller coupling term may be associated with the polaron-coupling constant of the surface phonon-electron interaction. A time-dependent expression for the Raman amplitude is developed, and we discuss the implications of these results for both metal and semiconductor nanoparticle surfaces.},

  abstract = {The B3LYP hybrid functional has shown to successfully predict a wide range of molecular properties. For periodic systems, however, the failure to attain the exact homogeneous electron gas limit as well as the semiempirical construction turns out to be a major drawback of the functional. We rigorously assess the B3LYP functional for solids through calculations of lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and thermochemical properties (atomization energies and reaction energies). The theoretical lattice constants overestimate the experimental ones by approximately 1%, and hence behave similarly to the PBE gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional. B3LYP atomization energies of solids are drastically worse than those of nonempirical hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functionals (HF/DFT) such as PBE0 and HSE03. These large errors can be traced back to the lack of a proper description of ``free-electron-lik'' systems with a significant itinerant character (metals and small gap semiconductors). Similar calculations using the popular semiempirical B3PW91 hybrid functional, which fulfills the uniform electron gas limit, show a clear improvement over B3LYP regarding atomization energies. Finally, theoretical values for heats of formation for both the B3LYP as well as the B3PW91 functionals are presented. These document a most likely fortuitously good agreement with experiment for the B3LYP hybrid functional.},

  abstract = {Details of a new density matrix-based formulation for calculating nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts at both Hartree-Fock and density functional theory levels are presented. For systems with a nonvanishing highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap, the method allows us to reduce the asymptotic scaling order of the computational effort from cubic to linear, so that molecular systems with 1000 and more atoms can be tackled with today's computers. The key feature is a reformulation of the coupled-perturbed self-consistent field (CPSCF) theory in terms of the one-particle density matrix (D-CPSCF), which avoids entirely the use of canonical MOs. By means of a direct solution for the required perturbed density matrices and the adaptation of linear-scaling integral contraction schemes, the overall scaling of the computational effort is reduced to linear. A particular focus of our formulation is to ensure numerical stability when sparse-algebra routines are used to obtain an overall linear-scaling behavior.},

  abstract = {Silver nanodimers with a small gap of a few nanometers aligned on glass substrates were used to enhance hyper-Raman scattering of crystal violet dye molecules. When localized surface plasmon of the dimer array was resonantly excited along the interparticle axis, hyper-Raman intensity was significantly enhanced. Moreover, the spectral appearance was slightly different between the two excitation polarizations, suggesting a possibility of two resonance contributions at one-photon and two-photon energies. Since the plasmonic property of dimer arrays can be controlled by the dimer geometry, the dimer arrays are expected to be well-defined substrates for surface-enhanced hyper-Raman spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {We present a method to calculate both on- and off-resonance vibrational Raman optical activities (VROAs) of molecules using time-dependent density functional theory. This is an extension of a method to calculate the normal VROA by including a finite lifetime of the electronic excited states in all calculated properties. The method is based on a short-time approximation to Raman scattering and is, in the off-resonance case, identical to the standard theory of Placzek. The normal and resonance VROA spectra are calculated from geometric derivatives of the different generalized polarizabilites obtained using linear response theory which includes a damping term to account for the finite lifetime. Gauge-origin independent results for normal VROA have been ensured using either the modified-velocity gauge or gauge-included atomic orbitals. For the resonance VROA only the modified-velocity gauge has been implemented. We present some initial results for H2O2 and (S)-methyloxirane and compare with predictions from a simple two-state approximation.},

  abstract = {We measured the Soret band of deoxymyoglobin (deoxyMb), myoglobin cyanide (MbCN), and aquo-metmyoglobin (all from horse heart) with absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. A clear non-coincidence was observed between the absorption and CD profiles of deoxyMb and MbCN, with the CD profiles red- and blueshifted with respect to the absorption band position, respectively. On the contrary, the CD and absorption profiles of aquametMb were nearly identical. The observed noncoincidence indicates a splitting of the excited B state due to heme-protein interactions. CD and absorption profiles of deoxyMb and MbCN were self-consistently analyzed by employing a perturbation approach for weak vibronic coupling as well as the relative intensities and depolarization ratios of seven bands in the respective resonance Raman spectra measured with B-band excitation. The respective By component was found to dominate the observed Cotton effect of both myoglobin derivatives. The different signs of the noncoincidences between CD and absorption bands observed for deoxyMb and MbCN are due to different signs of the respective matrix elements of A1g electronic interstate coupling, which reflects an imbalance of Gouterman's 50:50 states. The splitting of the B band reflects contributions from electronic and vibronic perturbations of B1g symmetry. The results of our analysis suggest that the broad and asymmetric absorption band of deoxyMb results from this band splitting rather than from its dependence on heme doming. Thus, we are able to explain recent findings that the temperature dependences of CO rebinding to myoglobin and the Soret band profile are uncorrelated[ Ormos et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

  abstract = {Many properties of atomic clusters have been found to be size dependent, e.g., the optical response. There are, however, factors other than size that can also play an important role in determining the properties of nanoscale systems. Temperature, in particular, has been shown to have a strong effect on the optical response of open-shell sodium clusters. We incorporate the temperature effect on the optical absorption spectra by combining pseudopotentials, Langevin molecular dynamics, and time-dependent density functional theory. We have done calculations for several open-shell sodium clusters, Na4+, Na7+, and Na11+, for which experimental data are available for comparison. We find that the positions of the lower energy peaks of the calculated spectra correspond very well to the peaks in the experimental spectra, although the local density approximation tends to overestimate the gap of the smaller clusters by up to 0.2 eV and underestimate the gap of the largest cluster by 0.4 eV. We fit the width of the peaks in the lower-temperature calculations to the corresponding experimental result to obtain the instrumental linewidth. We then use this same width for the high-temperature calculations and find very good agreement with experiment. Finally, we analyze the transitions that contribute to the observed peaks in the absorption spectra and we plot the effective valence charge density for specific transitions for each cluster. We find that for the two smaller clusters the absorption spectra are dominated by transitions from the occupied levels to a few (three for Na4+ and five for Na7+) empty levels, although the contribution from transitions to other empty levels can still be significant. In contrast, the absorption spectra for Na11+ come from a greater mixture of transitions as evidenced in the analysis as well as in the plot of the effective valence charge density.},

Here we present a much more satisfying derivation founded on second-order perturbation theory in the closure approximation and a semiclassical evaluation of the relevant interaction integrals. Expressions for C6, C8, and C10 dispersion coefficients are obtained in a remarkably straightforward manner. Their values agree very well with ab initio reference data on dispersion coefficients between the atoms H, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. We also highlight the importance of the exchange-hole contribution to the dispersion coefficients, especially to C6.},

  abstract = {Near-field interactions between plasmons and molecules are treated in a simple unified approach. The density matrix of a molecule is treated with linear-response random phase approximation and the plasmons are treated classically. The equations of motion for the combined system are linear, governed by a simple Liouvillian operator for the polariton (plasmon+molecule excitation) dynamics. The dynamics can be followed in time or directly in frequency space where a trace formula for the transmission is presented. A model system is studied, metal dots in a forklike arrangement, coupled to a two level system with a large transition-dipole moment. A Fano-type resonance [ Phys. Rev. 103, 1202 (1956) ] develops when the molecular response is narrower than the width of the absorption spectrum for the plasmons. We show that the direction of the dipole of the molecule determines the direction the polariton chooses. Further, the precise position of the molecule has a significant effect on the transfer.},

  abstract = {A general method for the simulation of absorption (ABS) and fluorescence band shapes, resonance-Raman (rR) spectra, and excitation profiles based on the time-dependent theory of Heller is discussed. The following improvements to Heller's theory have been made: (a) derivation of new recurrence relations for the time-dependent wave packet overlap in the case of frequency changes between the ground and electronically excited states, (b) a new series expansion that gives insight into the nature of Savin's preresonance approximation, (c) incorporation of inhomogeneous broadening effects into the formalism at no additional computational cost, and (d) derivation of a new and simple short-time dynamics based equation for the Stokes shift that remains valid in the case of partially resolved vibrational structure. Our implementation of the time-dependent theory for the fitting of experimental spectra and the simulation of model spectra as well as the quantum mechanical calculation of the model parameters is discussed. The implementation covers all electronic structure approaches which are able to deliver ground- and excited-state energies and transition dipole moments. The technique becomes highly efficient if analytic gradients for the excited-state surface are available. In this case, the computational cost for the simultaneous prediction of ABS, fluorescence, and rR spectra is equal to that of a single excited-state geometry optimization step while the limitations of the short-time dynamics approximation are completely avoided. As a test case we discuss the well-known case of the strongly allowed 1 1Ag-->1 1Bu transition in 1,3,5 trans-hexatriene in detail using method ranging from simple single-reference treatments to elaborate multireference electronic structure approaches. At the highest computational level, the computed spectra show the best agreement that has so far been obtained with quantum chemical methods for this problem.},

  abstract = {The absorption and resonance Raman spectra have been investigated for the first excited state of the julolidinemalononitrile push-pull chromophore in cyclohexane, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile by means of time dependent density functional theory calculations. The effect of nonlocal exchange has been considered by using three different hybrid exchange-correlation functionals containing 20%, 35%, and 50% of exact Hartree-Fock exchange. The interactions with the solvent have been described by the polarizable continuum model. The short-time approximation expression has been used to evaluate the resonance Raman intensities, while the vibronic theory of resonance Raman spectroscopy has been employed to determine both the intensities and the excitation profiles. It is shown that a consistent description of the vibronic structure of the excited state and resonance Raman spectra can be obtained provided that an adequate amount, close to 35%, of exact exchange is included in the exchange-correlation functional. The effect of increasing the polarity of the solvent is well represented by the polarizable continuum model, both for the absorption spectra and resonance Raman intensities. In particular, these simulations can reproduce the observed variations of the 1560 cm−1 band intensity and attribute them to elongations of a CC double bond upon electronic excitation. Moreover, the short-time approximation has been found sufficient to reproduce most of the results of the more evolved vibronic theory of resonance Raman spectroscopy, which includes summations over vibrational excited states, for both the spectral signatures and their solvent dependencies.},

  abstract = {The normally weak process of hyper-Raman scattering can be greatly enhanced when the excitation is two photon resonant with an electronic transition that is both one and two photon allowed. It might be expected to be further enhanced when a one-photon allowed transition provides an intermediate state resonance in the two-photon excitation step. The theory of this triply resonant process is developed for organic nonlinear chromophores. Experimental results are obtained for one donor-acceptor substituted push-pull chromophore in which the energy of the strongly allowed lowest-lying one-photon state may be tuned by varying the solvent without substantially affecting the two-photon resonant transition. Surprisingly, bringing the one-photon allowed state into resonance does not significantly increase the hyper-Rayleigh or hyper-Raman hyperpolarizabilities. Analysis of the resonance Raman, hyper-Rayleigh, and hyper-Raman profiles suggests that the triply resonant path does not make the dominant contribution to the hyperpolarizability in this system.},

The D-TDSCF method allows us to reduce the asymptotic scaling behavior of the computational effort from cubic to linear for systems with a nonvanishing band gap. The linear scaling is achieved by combining a density matrix-based reformulation of the TDSCF equations with linear-scaling schemes for the formation of Fock- or Kohn-Sham-type matrices. In our reformulation only potentially linear-scaling matrices enter the formulation and efficient sparse algebra routines can be employed. Furthermore, the corresponding formulas for the first hyperpolarizabilities are given in terms of zeroth- and first-order one-particle reduced density matrices according to Wigner's (2n+1) rule. The scaling behavior of our method is illustrated for first exemplary calculations with systems of up to 1011 atoms and 8899 basis functions.},

The degree of spatial overlap between the occupied and virtual orbitals involved in an excitation is measured using a quantity Lambda, and the extent to which excitation energy errors correlate with Lambda is quantified. For a set of 59 excitations of local, Rydberg, and intramolecular charge-transfer character in 18 theoretically challenging main-group molecules, CAM-B3LYP provides by far the best overall performance; no correlation is observed between excitation energy errors and Lambda, reflecting the good quality, balanced description of all three categories of excitation. By contrast, a clear correlation is observed for the GGA and, to a lesser extent, the hybrid functional, allowing a simple diagnostic test to be proposed for judging the reliability of a general excitation from these functionals-when Lambda falls below a prescribed threshold, excitations are likely to be in very significant error. The study highlights the ambiguous nature of the term ``charge transfer,'' providing insight into the observation that while many charge-transfer excitations are poorly described by GGA and hybrid functionals, others are accurately reproduced.},

  abstract = {The authors extend their recent method for the computation of vibrationally resolved optical spectra of large molecules, including both the Duschinsky rotation and the effect of finite temperature in the framework of the Franck-Condon (FC) approximation, to deal with the more general case of the Herzberg-Teller (HT) model, where also the linear dependence of the transition dipole moment on the nuclear coordinates is taken into account. This generalization allows us to investigate weak and vibronically allowed transitions by far extending the range of application of the method. The calculation of the spectra of sizable molecules is computationally demanding because of the huge number of final vibrational states that must be taken into account, and the inclusion of HT terms further increases the computational burden. The method presented here automatically selects the relevant vibronic contributions to the spectrum, independent of their frequency, and it is able to provide fully converged spectra with a modest computational requirement. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by computing the HT absorption and fluorescence Qx spectra of free-base porphyrin both at T = 0 K and at room temperature, performing for the first time an exact treatment of vibrations in harmonic approximation. Qx spectra are compared to experiments and FC/HT interferences are analyzed in detail.},

  abstract = {We present benchmark calculations using several long-range-corrected (LRC) density functionals, in which Hartree-Fock exchange is incorporated asymptotically using a range-separated Coulomb operator, while local exchange is attenuated using an ansatz introduced by Iikura et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 3540 (2001)]. We calculate ground-state atomization energies, reaction barriers, ionization energies, and electron affinities, each as a function of the range-separation parameter $\mu$. In addition, we calculate excitation energies of small- and medium-sized molecules, again as a function of $\mu$, by applying the LRC to time-dependent density functional theory. Representative examples of both pure and hybrid density functionals are tested. On the basis of these results, there does not appear to be a single range-separation parameter that is reasonable for both ground-state properties and vertical excitation energies. Reasonable errors in atomization energies and barrier heights are achieved only at the expense of excessively high excitation energies, at least for the medium-sized molecules, whereas values of $\mu$ that afford reasonable excitation energies yield some of the largest errors for ground-state atomization energies and barrier heights in small molecules. Notably, this conclusion is obscured if the database of excitation energies includes only small molecules, as has been the case in previous benchmark studies of LRC functionals.},

  abstract = {Calculations based on the Mie theory are performed to determine the locally enhanced electric fields due to whispering-gallery mode resonances for dielectric microspheres, with emphasis on electromagnetic ``hot spots'' that are located along the wavevector direction on the surface of the sphere. The local electric field enhancement associated with these hot spots is used to determine the surface enhanced Raman scattering enhancement factors for a molecule, here treated as a classical dipole, located near the surface of the sphere. Both incident and Raman emission enhancements are calculated accurately using an extension of the Mie theory that includes interaction of the Raman dipole field with the sphere. The enhancement factors are calculated for dielectric spheres in vacuum with a refractive index of 1.9 and radii of 5, 10, and 20 m and for wavelengths that span the visible spectrum. Maximum Raman scattering enhancement factors on the order of 103-104 are found at locations slightly off the propagation axis when the incident excitation but not the Stokes-shifted radiation is coincident with a whispering-gallery mode resonance. The enhancement factors are found to vary inversely with the resonance width, and this determines the influence of the mode number and order on the results. Additional calculations are performed for the case where the Stokes-shifted radiation is also on-resonance and Raman enhancement factors as large as 108 are found. These enhancement factors are typically a factor of 102 smaller than would be obtained from E4 enhancement estimates, as enhancement of the Raman dipole emission is significantly reduced compared to the local field enhancement for micron size particles or larger. Conditions under which single-molecule or few-molecule measurements are feasible are identified.},

We test two limiting cases: screened local hybrids with no long-range HF exchange and long-range-corrected local hybrids with 100\% long-range HF exchange. Long-range-corrected local hybrids provide the exact asymptotic exchange-correlation potential in finite systems, while screened local hybrids avoid the problems inherent to long-range HF exchange in metals and small-bandgap systems. We treat these functionals self-consistently using the nonlocal exchange potential constructed from Kohn-Sham orbital derivatives. Generalized Kohn-Sham calculations with screened and long-range-corrected local hybrids can provide accurate molecular thermochemistry and kinetics, comparable to existing local hybrids of full-range exchange. Generalized Kohn-Sham calculations with existing full-range local hybrids provide results consistent with previous non-self-consistent and ``localized local hybrid'' calculations. These new functionals appear to provide a promising extension of existing local and range-separated hybrids.},

By taking the uniform electron gas limit of the correction term and using alternative definitions of the average relative electron momentum that are motivated by analysis of the Negele-Vautherin density matrix expansion, we recover the "modified Slater potential" of Harbola and Sen and the much more accurate Becke-Johnson approximation [J.

The relativistic effects not only dictate the stabilization of planar geometries (as it has already been shown by treating the core electrons relativistically): The spin-orbit coupling also has a strong impact in the absorption spectra (resonances and oscillator strengths). This is especially true for nanowires, where the effect of spin orbit is large and not substantially reduced with the chain length, in contrast to more compact gold clusters where this spin-orbit effect tends to be quenched. These results have far reaching consequences in fields such as electronic transport, where gold nanowires are often used, but where spin-orbit effects are generally disregarded.},

  abstract = {Two-photon photoemission spectroscopy is employed to elucidate the electronic structure and the excitation mechanism in the photoinduced isomerization of the molecular switch tetra-tert-butyl-azobenzene (TBA) adsorbed on Au(111). Our results demonstrate that the optical excitation and the mechanism of molecular switching at a metal surface is completely different compared to the corresponding process for the free molecule. In contrast to direct (intramolecular) excitation operative in the isomerization in the liquid phase, the conformational change in the surface-bound TBA is driven by a substrate-mediated charge transfer process. We find that photoexcitation above a threshold hnu[approximate]2.2 eV leads to hole formation in the Au d-band followed by a hole transfer to the highest occupied molecular orbital of TBA. This transiently formed positive ion resonance subsequently results in a conformational change. The photon energy dependent photoisomerization cross section exhibit an unusual shape for a photochemical reaction of an adsorbate on a metal surface. It shows a thresholdlike behavior below hnu[approximate]2.2 eV and above hnu[approximate]4.4 eV. These thresholds correspond to the minimum energy required to create single or multiple hot holes in the Au d-bands, respectively. This study provides important new insights into the use of light to control the structure and function of molecular switches in direct contact with metal electrodes.},

Response functions and response equations are expressed in the atomic orbital basis, allowing recent advances in the field of linear-scaling methodology to be used. Time-dependent and static perturbations are treated on an equal footing, and atomic basis sets that depend on the applied frequency-dependent perturbations may be used, e.g., frequency-dependent London atomic orbitals. The 2n+1 rule may be applied if computationally favorable, but alternative formulations using higher-order perturbed density matrices are also derived. These may be advantageous in order to minimize the number of response equations that needs to be solved, for instance, when one of the perturbations has many components, as is the case for the first-order geometrical derivative of the hyperpolarizability.},

The performance of this functional, for ground-state properties and for vertical excitation energies within time-dependent density functional theory, is systematically evaluated, and optimal values are determined for the range-separation parameter, omega, and for the fraction of short-range Hartree-Fock exchange. We denote the new functional as LRC-\omegaPBEh, since it reduces to the standard PBEh hybrid functional (also known as PBE0 or PBE1PBE) for a certain choice of its two parameters. Upon optimization of these parameters against a set of ground- and excited-state benchmarks, the LRC-\omegaPBEh functional fulfills three important requirements: (i) It outperforms the PBEh hybrid functional for ground-state atomization energies and reaction barrier heights; (ii) it yields statistical errors comparable to PBEh for valence excitation energies in both small and medium-sized molecules; and (iii) its performance for charge-transfer excitations is comparable to its performance for valence excitations. LRC-\omegaPBEh, with the parameters determined herein, is the first density functional that satisfies all three criteria.

This approach is suitable for describing surface plasmons on metal nanostructures interacting in the near field with nearby dipolar molecules or semiconductor nanostructures. The approach is applied to three collinear 5 nm diameter gold nanoparticles; the results demonstrate that a nearby molecule strongly affects surface plasmon transfer along the array. Specifically, an xy oriented molecule situated midway between the second and third nanoparticles exhibits a symmetric Fano-type inference effect. Transmission of incident x-polarized energy from the second nanoparticle to the third is enhanced over a frequency range below the molecular resonance, and partially scattered into y-polarized currents for frequencies above. At the molecule's resonance frequency, the magnitude of the resulting y-current is approximately 20% of the x-current.},

This approach combines Becke and Johnson's [J. Chem.

Due to the availability of atomic polarizability tensors, the method is extended to incorporate anisotropic contributions, which prove to be important for complexes of lower symmetry. The method is validated for a set of 18 complexes, for which interaction energies were obtained with the B3LYP, PBE, and TPSS functionals combined with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set and compared with the values obtained at the CCSD(T) level extrapolated to a complete basis set limit. It is shown that very good quality interaction energies can be obtained by the proposed method for each of the examined functionals, the overall performance of the TPSS functional being the best, which with a slope of 1.00 in the linear regression equation and a constant term of only 0.1 kcal/mol allows to obtain accurate interaction energies without any need of a damping function for complexes close to their exact equilibrium geometry.},

  abstract = {We report the implementation of a frequency-dependent two-component relativistic density functional theory method based on the zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) for computations of complex linear response of molecules including spin-orbit coupling. The implementation is based on Slater-type atomic orbital basis functions and makes extensive use of density fitting techniques. The complex response is obtained by applying damping in the computations. The method is validated by computations of the real and imaginary part of the static and dynamic polarizability of group 12 atoms, of a number of heavy-atom diatomic molecules, of a range of two- and three-dimensional gold clusters, and of group 8 oxides and metallocenes. Simulated spectra-a plot of extinction coefficient as a function of frequency-obtained from the isotropic imaginary polarizability are compared to broadened spectra obtained from two-component ZORA excitation energies and oscillator strengths.},

  abstract = {We found a binary active site of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and surface enhanced hyper Raman scattering (SEHRS) in single Ag nanoaggregates by single particle spectroscopy. The intensity fluctuation of SEHRS was canceled by dividing SEHRS intensity by SERS intensity on the basis of the binary active site analysis. Thanks to the identification of the plasmons common to both SERS and SEHRS we revealed that an enormous enhancement in SEHRS is ascribed to the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement entirely coupled with longitudinal plasmon modes excluding other kinds of enhancement factors. Our results indicate that EM enhancement factors of metal nanostructures are estimated from spectral information on the longitudinal plasmon resonance band obtained by the scattering or absorption spectra of the nanostructures.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations have been performed to investigate the Raman scattering spectra of metal-molecule complex and metal-molecule-metal junction architectures interconnected with 4-aminothiophenol (PATP) molecule. The simulated profiles of normal Raman scattering (NRS) spectra for the two complexes (Ag2-PATP and PATP-Au2) and the two junctions (Ag2-PATP-Au2 and Au2-PATP-Ag2) are similar to each other, but exhibit obviously different Raman intensities. Due to the lager static polarizabilities of the two junctions, which directly influence the ground state chemical enhancement in NRS spectra, the calculated normal Raman intensities of them are stronger than those of two complexes by the factor of 102. We calculate preresonance Raman scattering (RRS) spectra with incident light at 1064 nm, which is much lower than the S1 electronic transition energy of complexes and junctions. Ag2-PATP-Au2 and Au2-PATP-Ag2 junctions yield higher Raman intensities than those of Ag2-PATP and PATP-Au2 complexes, especially for b2 modes. This effect is mainly attributed to charge transfer (CT) between the metal gap and the PAPT molecule which results in the occurrence of CT resonance enhancement. The calculated pre-RRS spectra strongly depend on the electronic transition state produced by new structures. With excitation at 514.5 nm, the calculated pre-RRS spectra of two complexes and two junctions are stronger than those of with excitation at 1064 nm. A charge difference densities methodology has been used to visually describe chemical enhancement mechanism of RRS spectrum. This methodology aims at visualizing intermolecular CT which provides direct evidence of the Herzberg-Teller mechanism.},

  abstract = {Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of pyridine adsorbed on Au@Pd core/shell nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically with quantum chemical method, generalized Mie theory and three-dimensional finite-difference time domain (3D-FDTD) method. We first studied the influence of the coated Pd on the electronic structure of Au nanoparticle, and compared the electronic structure of Au20 cluster with that of Au10Pd10 (core/shell) cluster. Second, we studied SERS spectroscopy of pyridine on Au@Pd core/shell nanoparticles, which revealed the rate of static chemical enhancement and electromagnetic enhancement in the experimental reports. Third, the influence of the Pd shell thickness to the optical absorption of Au@Pd core/shell nanoparticles was investigated with generalized Mie theory. Fourth, we studied the influence of the shell thickness to the local electric field enhancement with 3D-FDTD method. The theoretical results reveal that the static chemical enhancement and electromagnetic enhancement are in the order of 10 and 103, respectively. These theoretical studies promote the deeper understanding of the electronic structure and optical absorption properties of Au@Pd, and the mechanisms for SERS of molecule adsorbed on Au@Pd.},

Electronic propagators or Green's functions, accounting for the repeated polarization interaction between a single molecule and its image in a nearby nanoscale metal, are explicitly computed and used to construct the linear-response properties of the combined molecule-metal system to an external electromagnetic perturbation. Shifting and finite lifetime of states appear rigorously and automatically within our approach and reveal an intricate coupling between molecule and metal not fully described by previous theories. Self-consistent incorporation of this quantum-molecular response into the continuum-electromagnetic scattering of the molecule-metal target is exploited to compute the localized surface-plasmon resonance wavelength shift with respect to the bare metal from first principles.},

  abstract = {The absorption spectra and ionization potentials of silver clusters $Ag_n$ (n=4--20) are examined in the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) using several different methods of representing the exchange-correlation functional. Three different types of exchange-correlation functionals are used: those including gradient corrections to the density in the generalized gradient approximation, global hybrid functionals mixing in a portion of the Hartree-Fock exchange, and long-range corrected (LC-) functionals. Comparison of ionization potentials calculated using DFT to those derived from experiments demonstrate that LC-functionals more accurately represent the electronic structure of the silver clusters studied. Absorption spectra are compared to both experimental spectra and those derived using higher level theoretical calculations showing that the LC-functionals appear to correctly describe the optical transitions in the gas phase, particularly when a small redshift in the experimental spectrum is accounted for due to matrix effects. It is also demonstrated that the LC-hybrid functionals significantly reduce the occurrence of spurious states in the optical absorbance spectrum while maintaining the intensity of plasmon-like features of the spectra for larger silver clusters.},

  abstract = {Vibrational frequency calculations were made for a Ag10-pyridine vertex complex with density functional theory (DFT) for static simulated spectra and with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for preresonance and resonance simulated spectra using both B3LYP/LANL2DZ and BP86/TZP methodologies. In addition, 40 excited states of the complex were calculated and assigned symmetry based on a C2v symmetry of the optimized complex found with B3LYP/LANL2DZ. Molecular orbital isosurfaces show that the excited states involve both Ag10 intercluster excitations and charge-transfer (CT) excitations between the Ag nanocluster and the pyridine molecule. An excitation around 500 nm involving CT from the Ag cluster to pyridine was found in both calculations. For free pyridine, the relative average deviations between unscaled calculated and experimental results were 1.5?cm-1 for BP86 and 3.1?cm-1 for the B3LYP calculations. For the complex, simulated spectra at a variety of excitation wavelengths were calculated. In the case of 514 nm excitation, the simulated Raman cross section from the TD-DFT calculations (near the CT resonance) was plotted versus Raman shift frequency and compared with an experimental surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum obtained on an oxidation-reduction cycle, ORC roughened Ag electrode. The BP86 TD-DFT calculation with finite damping term showed a better fit to experimental spectrum with respect to both relative intensities and frequencies. The average deviation of the unscaled BP86 calculations for 16 bands in the experimental spectrum was 13.0?cm-1. The calculated spectrum in both cases shows many contributions from nontotally symmetric as well as totally symmetric modes, indicating the contribution of Herzberg-Teller (HT) scattering. The simulated intensities of the Raman modes of different symmetry from Ag10-pyridine can be correlated with HT intensity borrowing from excited states of given symmetry and decent oscillator strength. These results explain the appearance of the a2 mode at 388?cm-1 and the moderately strong b2 mode at 1573?cm-1 found in the SERS experimental spectrum. The good agreement between experimental and simulated results indicates that a small Ag nanocluster-pyridine vertex complex can be used to simulate spectra with good relative intensities, if not absolute intensities, and accurate frequencies for most of the SERS bands for adsorbed pyridine on roughened bulk Ag.},

Although CPCM/TD-B3LYP method may not be accurate in predicting solvent effect on vertical excitation of TMpCA−, it may be used to predict redshiftings of emission maxima relative to absorption maxima with an accuracy of ∼ 0.1 eV. We also found that the excited trans-TMpCA− tends to form a single bond twisted structure in the gas phase but a double bond twisted structure in aqueous solution. The TD-B3LYP minimum energy isomerization pathway shows a barrier of 3.6 kcal/mol in aqueous solution and 5.2 kcal/mol in the gas phase. The gas phase double bond twisted structure is trapped in a well of the excited state PES, with a depth of ∼ 20 kcal/mol (0.88 eV), in good agreement with an experimental value of ∼ 1 eV.},

Calculated Raman spectra were found to match well with experiment and previous theoretical calculations. The calculated normal and surface enhanced hyper-Raman spectra closely match experimental results. The chemical enhancement factors for hyper-Raman are generally larger than for Raman (102−104 versus 101−102). Integrated hyper-Raman chemical enhancement factors are presented for a set of substituted pyridines. A two-state model is developed to predict these chemical enhancement factors and this was found to work well for the majority of the molecules considered, providing a rationalization for the difference between hyper-Raman and Raman enhancement factors.},

  abstract = {A new polarizable quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method for the calculation of response properties of molecules adsorbed on metal nanoparticles is presented. This method, which we denote the discrete interaction model/quantum mechanics (DIM/QM) method, represents the nanoparticle atomistically which enable the modeling of the influence of the local environment of a nanoparticle surface on the optical properties of a molecule. Using DIM/QM, we investigate the excitation energies of rhodamine-6G (R6G) and crystal violet (CV) adsorbed on silver and gold nanoparticles of different quasispherical shapes and sizes. The metal nanoparticle is characterized by its static total polarizability, a reasonable approximation for frequencies far from the plasmon resonance. We observe that for both R6G and CV, the presence of the nanoparticle shifts the strongest excitation to the red $\sim$40 nm and also increases the oscillator strength of that excitation. The shifts in excitation energies due to the nanoparticle surface are found to be comparable to those due to solvation. We find that these shifts decay quickly as the molecule is moved away from the surface. We also find that the wavelength shift is largest when the transition dipole moment is aligned with the edges of the nanoparticle surface where the electric field is expected to be the largest. These results show that the molecular excitations are sensitive to the local environment on the nanoparticle as well as the specific orientation of the molecule relative to the surface.},

Ag nanoaggregate-by-nanoaggregate variations in background light emission spectra are related to plasma (plasmon) resonance spectra. Temporal variations in background light emission spectra with temporal blueshifts in plasma resonance spectra are also observed under continuous laser excitation. Both types of the variations in background light emission are reproduced by multiplying background light emission spectra measured from a Ag microaggregate by Lorentz function spectra derived from plasma resonance spectra. The reproduction reveals that second electromagnetic (EM) enhancement by plasma resonance is the origin of the variations. Additionally, spectral variations in background light emission of SERHRS are similar to that of surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS). The similarity indicates that both types of background light emission commonly obtain second EM enhancement from identical plasma resonance.},

All the forces and torques involving induced dipoles can be efficiently evaluated using standard electrostatic formulas as if the induced dipoles were permanent dipoles. The formulas are given in the most general form and are applicable to various flavors of polarizable force fields.

  abstract = {The solvent effect on the absorption spectra of coumarin 120 (C120) in water was studied utilizing the combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method. In molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a new sampling scheme was introduced to provide enough samples for both solute and solvent molecules to obtain the average physical properties of the molecules in solution. We sampled the structure of the solute and solvent molecules separately. First, we executed a QM/MM MD simulation, where we sampled the solute molecule in solution. Next, we chose random solute structures from this simulation and performed classical MD simulation for each chosen solute structure with its geometry fixed. This new scheme allowed us to sample the solute molecule quantum mechanically and sample many solvent structures classically. Excitation energy calculations using the selected samples were carried out by the generalized multiconfigurational perturbation theory. We succeeded in constructing the absorption spectra and realizing the red shift of the absorption spectra found in polar solvents. To understand the motion of C120 in water, we carried out principal component analysis and found that the motion of the methyl group made the largest contribution and the motion of the amino group the second largest. The solvent effect on the absorption spectrum was studied by decomposing it in two components: the effect from the distortion of the solute molecule and the field effect from the solvent molecules. The solvent effect from the solvent molecules shows large contribution to the solvent shift of the peak of the absorption spectrum, while the solvent effect from the solute molecule shows no contribution. The solvent effect from the solute molecule mainly contributes to the broadening of the absorption spectrum. In the solvent effect, the variation in C-C bond length has the largest contribution on the absorption spectrum from the solute molecule. For the solvent effect on the absorption spectrum from the solvent molecules, the solvent structure around the amino group of C120 plays the key role.},

Both molecules are representative of a family of 5-nitrofuran-ethenyl-quinoline drugs that have been demonstrated to display high toxicity to various species of transformed cells in the dark. We determine the two-photon absorption cross-section for both compounds, from 560 to 880 nm, which present peak values of 64 GM for quinifuryl and 20 GM for nitrofurantoine (1 GM = 1\texttimes10−50cm4.s.photon−1). Besides, theoretical calculations employing the linear and quadratic response functions were carried out at the density functional theory level to aid the interpretations of the experimental results. The theoretical results yielded oscillator strengths, two-photon transition probabilities, and transition energies, which are in good agreement with the experimental data. A higher number of allowed electronic transitions was identified for quinifuryl in comparison to nitrofurantoine by the theoretical calculations. Due to the planar structure of both compounds, the differences in the two-photon absorption cross-section values are a consequence of their distinct conjugation lengths.},

  abstract = {Vibronic coupling within the excited electronic manifold of the solute all-trans-$\beta$-carotene through the vibrational motions of the solvent cyclohexane is shown to manifest as the ``molecular near-field effect,'' in which the solvent hyper-Raman bands are subject to marked intensity enhancements under the presence of all-trans-$\beta$-carotene. The resonance hyper-Raman excitation profiles of the enhanced solvent bands exhibit similar peaks to those of the solute bands in the wavenumber region of 21 700-25 000 cm−1 (10 850-12 500 cm−1 in the hyper-Raman exciting wavenumber), where the solute all-trans-$\beta$-carotene shows a strong absorption assigned to the 1Ag \textrightarrow 1Bu transition. This fact indicates that the solvent hyper-Raman bands gain their intensities through resonances with the electronic states of the solute. The observed excitation profiles are quantitatively analyzed and are successfully accounted for by an extended vibronic theory of resonance hyper-Raman scattering that incorporates the vibronic coupling within the excited electronic manifold of all-trans-$\beta$-carotene through the vibrational motions of cyclohexane. It is shown that the major resonance arises from the B-term (vibronic) coupling between the first excited vibrational level (v = 1) of the 1Bu state and the ground vibrational level (v = 0) of a nearby Ag state through ungerade vibrational modes of both the solute and the solvent molecules. The inversion symmetry of the solute all-trans-$\beta$-carotene is preserved, suggesting the weak perturbative nature of the solute-solvent interaction in the molecular near-field effect. The present study introduces a new concept, ``intermolecular vibronic coupling,'' which may provide an experimentally accessible/theoretically tractable model for understanding weak solute-solvent interactions in liquid.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the implementation of efficient approximations to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) for hybrid density functionals. For the calculation of the TDDFT/TDA excitation energies and analytical gradients, we combine the resolution of identity (RI-J) algorithm for the computation of the Coulomb terms and the recently introduced ``chain of spheres exchange'' (COSX) algorithm for the calculation of the exchange terms. It is shown that for extended basis sets, the RIJCOSX approximation leads to speedups of up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, as demonstrated for hydrocarbon chains. The accuracy of the adiabatic transition energies, excited state structures, and vibrational frequencies is assessed on a set of 27 excited states for 25 molecules with the configuration interaction singles and hybrid TDDFT/TDA methods using various basis sets. Compared to the canonical values, the typical error in transition energies is of the order of 0.01 eV. Similar to the ground-state results, excited state equilibrium geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5\textdegree in the bond angles from the canonical values. The typical error in the calculated excited state normal coordinate displacements is of the order of 0.01, and relative error in the calculated excited state vibrational frequencies is less than 1%. The errors introduced by the RIJCOSX approximation are, thus, insignificant compared to the errors related to the approximate nature of the TDDFT methods and basis set truncation. For TDDFT/TDA energy and gradient calculations on Ag-TB2-helicate (156 atoms, 2732 basis functions), it is demonstrated that the COSX algorithm parallelizes almost perfectly (speedup ∼26-29 for 30 processors). The exchange-correlation terms also parallelize well (speedup ∼27-29 for 30 processors). The solution of the Z-vector equations shows a speedup of ∼24 on 30 processors. The parallelization efficiency for the Coulomb terms can be somewhat smaller (speedup ∼15-25 for 30 processors), but their contribution to the total calculation time is small. Thus, the parallel program completes a Becke3-Lee-Yang-Parr energy and gradient calculation on the Ag-TB2-helicate in less than 4 h on 30 processors. We also present the necessary extension of the Lagrangian formalism, which enables the calculation of the TDDFT excited state properties in the frozen-core approximation. The algorithms described in this work are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system.},

  abstract = {Damped response theory is applied to the calculation of two-photon absorption (TPA) spectra, which are determined directly, at each frequency, from a modified damped cubic response function. The TPA spectrum may therefore be evaluated for selected frequency ranges, making the damped TPA approach attractive for calculations on large molecules with a high density of states, where the calculation of TPA using standard theory is more problematic. Damped response theory can also be applied to the case of intermediate state resonances, where the standard TPA expression is divergent. Both exact damped response theory and its application within density functional theory are discussed. The latter is implemented using an atomic-orbital based density matrix formulation, which makes the approach especially suitable for studies on large systems. A test preliminary study is presented for the TPA spectrum of R-(+)-1,1′-bi(2-naphtol).},

  abstract = {A frequency-dependent quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method for the calculation of response properties of molecules adsorbed on metal nanoparticles is presented. This discrete interaction model/quantum mechanics (DIM/QM) method represents the nanoparticle atomistically, thus accounting for the local environment of the nanoparticle surface on the optical properties of the adsorbed molecule. Using the DIM/QM method, we investigate the coupling between the absorption of a silver nanoparticle and of a substituted naphthoquinone. This system is chosen since it shows strong coupling due to a molecular absorption peak that overlaps with the plasmon excitation in the metal nanoparticle. We show that there is a strong dependence not only on the distance of the molecule from the metal nanoparticle but also on its orientation relative to the nanoparticle. We find that when the transition dipole moment of an excitation is oriented towards the nanoparticle there is a significant increase in the molecular absorption as a result of coupling to the metal nanoparticle. In contrast, we find that the molecular absorption is decreased when the transition dipole moment is oriented parallel to the metal nanoparticle. The coupling between the molecule and the metal nanoparticle is found to be surprisingly long range and important on a length scale comparable to the size of the metal nanoparticle. A simple analytical model that describes the molecule and the metal nanoparticle as two interacting point objects is found to be in excellent agreement with the full DIM/QM calculations over the entire range studied. The results presented here are important for understanding plasmon-exciton hybridization, plasmon enhanced photochemistry, and single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering.},

  abstract = {By considering the molecule and metal to form a conjoined system, we derive an expression for the observed Raman spectrum in surface-enhanced Raman scattering. The metal levels are considered to consist of a continuum with levels filled up to the Fermi level, and empty above, while the molecule has discrete levels filled up to the highest occupied orbital, and empty above that. It is presumed that the Fermi level of the metal lies between the highest filled and the lowest unfilled level of the molecule. The molecule levels are then coupled to the metal continuum both in the filled and unfilled levels, and using the solutions to this problem provided by Fano, we derive an expression for the transition amplitude between the ground stationary state and some excited stationary state of the molecule-metal system. It is shown that three resonances contribute to the overall enhancement; namely, the surface plasmon resonance, the molecular resonances, as well as charge-transfer resonances between the molecule and metal. Furthermore, these resonances are linked by terms in the numerator, which result in SERS selection rules. These linked resonances cannot be separated, accounting for many of the observed SERS phenomena. The molecule-metal coupling is interpreted in terms of a deformation potential which is compared to the Herzberg-Teller vibronic coupling constant. We show that one term in the sum involves coupling between the surface plasmon transition dipole and the molecular transition dipole. They are coupled through the deformation potential connecting to charge-transfer states. Another term is shown to involve coupling between the charge-transfer transition and the molecular transition dipoles. These are coupled by the deformation potential connecting to plasmon resonance states. By applying the selection rules to the cases of dimer and trimer nanoparticles we show that the SERS spectrum can vary considerably with excitation wavelength, depending on which plasmon and/or charge-transfer resonance is excited.},

  abstract = {We have derived and implemented analytical gradients for the discrete interaction model/quantum mechanics (DIM/QM) method. DIM/QM combines an atomistic electrodynamics model with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and thus enables modeling the optical properties of a molecule while taking into account the local environment of a nanoparticle's surface. The DIM/QM analytical gradients allow for geometry optimizations, vibrational frequencies and Raman spectra to be simulated for molecules interacting with metal nanoparticles. We have simulated the surface-enhance Raman scattering (SERS) spectra for pyridine adsorbed on different sites of icosahedral nanoparticles with diameters between $1-8$ nm. To describe the adsorption of the pyridine molecule onto the metal surface, we have implemented a coordination-dependent force field to differentiate the various local surface environments. We find that the DIM/QM method predicts geometries and frequencies that are in good agreement with full QM simulations and experiments. For the simulated SERS spectra of pyridine, we find a significant dependence on the adsorption site and the size of the metal nanoparticle. This illustrates the importance of accounting for the local environment around the molecule. The Raman enhancement factors are shown to roughly mirror the magnitude of the nanoparticle's local field about the molecule. Because the simulated nanoparticles are small, the plasmon peaks are quite broad which results in weak local electric fields and thus modest Raman enhancement factors.},

The degree of intensity enhancement is strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength, with a sharp resonance Raman maximum for excitation at the wavelength of the Mie extinction maximum of the metal particles, and for the silver sols the Raman maximum is shown to follow the extinction maximum to longer wavelengths with increase in particle size. A new resonance Raman phenomenon is thus proposed which is the Raman component of resonant Mie scattering, and in which the polarizability of the metal particles is modulated by the vibrations of the adsorbed molecules. These observations confirm that surface plasma oscillations are involved in the intense Raman scattering already reported for molecules adsorbed at roughened silver surfaces. The metal dielectric function requirements for resonant Mie scattering enable the optimum excitation wavelength for plasma resonance-enhanced Raman studies at the surface of other metals to be estimated.},

  abstract = {Using as benchmarks a series of increasingly large hydrated uracil clusters, we examine the nature and extent of charge-transfer (CT) contamination in condensed-phase, time-dependent density-functional theory. These calculations are plagued by a large number of spurious CT excitations at energies comparable to (and sometimes below) the valence excitation energies, even when hybrid density functionals are used. Spurious states below the first n$\pi$* and $\pi$$\pi$* states of uracil are observed in clusters as small as uracil−(H2O)4. Reasonable electronic absorption spectra can still be obtained, upon configurational averaging, despite pervasive CT contamination, but the spurious states add significantly to the cost of the calculations and severely complicate attempts to locate optically dark n$\pi$* states. The extent of CT contamination is reduced substantially by introducing an electrostatic (point charge) description of an extended solvent network, even in cases where the region of solvent described by density functional theory is large (>120 atoms). Alternatively, CT contamination may be reduced by eliminating certain excitation amplitudes from the linear response equations, with minimal loss of accuracy (<0.1 eV) in the valence excitation energies.},

  abstract = {The pi pi* transitions of more than 100 organic dyes from the major classes of chromophores (quinones, diazo, ...) have been investigated using a Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) procedure relying on large atomic basis sets and the systematic modeling of solvent effects. These calculations have been performed with pure (PBE) as well as conventional (PBE0) and long-range (LR) corrected hybrid functionals (LC-PBE, LC-omegaPBE, and CAM-B3LYP). The computed wavelengths are systematically guided by the percentage of exact exchange included at intermediate interelectronic distance, i.e., the lambdamax value always follows the PBE > PBE0 > CAM-B3LYP > LC-PBE > LC-omegaPBE > HF sequence. The functional giving the best estimates of the experimental transition energies may vary, but PBE0 and CAM-B3LYP tend to outperform all other approaches. The latter functional is shown to be especially adequate to treat molecules with delocalized excited states. The mean absolute error provided by PBE0 is 22 nm (0.14 eV) with no deviation exceeding 100 nm (0.50 eV): PBE0 is able to deliver reasonable estimates of the color of most organic dyes of practical or industrial interest. By using a calibration curve, we found that the LR functionals systematically allow an even more consistent description of the low-lying excited-state energies than the conventional hybrids. Indeed, linearly corrected LR approaches yield an average error of 10 nm for each dye family. Therefore, when such statistical treatments can be designed for given sets of dyes, a simple and rapid theoretical procedure allows both a chemically sound and a numerically accurate description of the absorption wavelengths.},

Three hybrid functionals with varying amounts of exact exchange were tested, and the calculated one-photon absorption spectra for each of the molecular systems were shown to be in qualitative agreement with the measured spectra. All three functionals predict a large enhancement in the TPA cross-section for the dimer relative to the monomer, in agreement with experimental results. However, because of the sensitivity of the resonance enhancement factor to small differences in the relevant state energies, quantitative prediction of the TPA cross-section by this method is still a challenge.},

The algorithm was implemented and applied to two molecules, taxol and valinomycin. The errors in the total energies were about 10−5 a.u., which is accurate enough for practical usage. If the exchange-correlation term is split into a simple analytic model potential and the correction to it, and only the latter is calculated with the GPU, the energy error is decreased by an order of magnitude. The resulting time to compute the exchange-correlation term is smaller than it is on the latest CPU by a factor of 10, indicating that a GPU running the proposed algorithm accelerates the density functional calculation considerably.},

  abstract = {By admixing a fraction of exact Hartree−Fock-type exchange with conventional semilocal functionals, global hybrids greatly improve the accuracy of Kohn−Sham density functional theory. However, because global hybrids exhibit incorrect asymptotic decay of the exchange-correlation potential, they can have large errors for diverse quantities such as reaction barrier heights, nonlinear optical properties, and Rydberg and charge-transfer excitation energies. These errors can be removed by using a long-range-corrected hybrid, which uses exact exchange in the long range. Evaluating the long-range-corrected exchange energy requires a model for the semilocal exchange hole, and such models are scarce. Recently, two of us introduced one such model (J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 194105). This model obeys several exact constraints and was designed specifically for use in long-range-corrected hybrids. Here, we give sample results for three long-range-corrected hybrids based upon our exchange hole model and show how the model can easily be applied to any generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange energy to create a long-range-corrected GGA.},

  abstract = { Some fundamental issues in ground-state density functional theory are discussed without equations: (1) The standard Hohenberg-Kohn and Kohn-Sham theorems were proven for a Hamiltonian that is not quite exact for real atoms, molecules, and solids. (2) The density functional for the exchange-correlation energy, which must be approximated, arises from the tendency of electrons to avoid one another as they move through the electron density. (3) In the absence of a magnetic field, either spin densities or total electron density can be used, although the former choice is better for approximations. (4) ``Spin contamination'' of the determinant of Kohn-Sham orbitals for an open-shell system is not wrong but right. (5) Only to the extent that symmetries of the interacting wave function are reflected in the spin densities should those symmetries be respected by the Kohn-Sham noninteracting or determinantal wave function. Functionals below the highest level of approximations should however sometimes break even those symmetries, for good physical reasons. (6) Simple and commonly used semilocal (lower-level) approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the density can be accurate for closed systems near equilibrium and yet fail for open systems of fluctuating electron number. (7) The exact Kohn-Sham noninteracting state need not be a single determinant, but common approximations can fail when it is not. (8) Over an open system of fluctuating electron number, connected to another such system by stretched bonds, semilocal approximations make the exchange-correlation energy and hole-density sum rule too negative. (9) The gap in the exact Kohn-Sham band structure of a crystal underestimates the real fundamental gap but may approximate the first exciton energy in the large-gap limit. (10) Density functional theory is not really a mean-field theory, although it looks like one. The exact functional includes strong correlation, and semilocal approximations often overestimate the strength of static correlation through their semilocal exchange contributions. (11) Only under rare conditions can excited states arise directly from a ground-state theory. },

  abstract = { A diversity-oriented approach for the generation of thermochemical benchmark sets is presented. Test sets consisting of randomly generated ``artificial molecule'' (AMs) are proposed that rely on systematic constraints rather than uncontrolled chemical biases. In this way, the narrow structural space of chemical intuition is opened up and electronically difficult cases can be produced in an unforeseeable manner. For the calculation of chemically meaningful relative energies, AMs are systematically decomposed into small molecules (hydrides and diatomics). Two different example test sets containing eight-atom, single-reference, main group AMs with chemically very diverse and unusual structures are generated. Highly accurate all-electron, estimated CCSD(T)/complete basis set reference energies are also provided. They are used to benchmark the density functionals S-VWN, BP86, B-LYP, B97-D, PBE, TPSS, PBEh, BH-LYP, B3-PW91, B3-LYP, B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, BMK, MPW1B95, M05, M05-2X, PW6B95, M06, M06-L, and M06-2X. In selected cases, an empirical dispersion correction (DFT-D) has been applied. Due to the composition of the sets, it is expected that a good performance indicates ``robustness'' in many different chemical applications. The results of a statistical analysis of the errors for the entire set with 165 entries (average reaction energy of 117 kcal/mol, dubbed as the MB08-165 set) perfectly fit to the ``Jacob's ladder'' metaphor for the ordering of density functionals according to their theoretical complexity. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) decreases very strongly from LDA (20 kcal/mol) to GGAs (MAD of about 10 kcal/mol) but then was less pronounced to hybrid-GGAs (MAD of about 6-8 kcal/mol). The best performance (MAD of 4.1-4.2 kcal/mol) is found for the (fifth-rung) double-hybrid functionals B2-PLYP-D and B2GP-PLYP-D, followed by the M06-2X meta-hybrid (MAD of 4.8 kcal/mol). The significance of the proposed approach for thermodynamic benchmarking is discussed and related to the observed performance ranking also regarding wave function based methods. },

  abstract = {We present a Lagrangian approach for the calculation of molecular (quadratic) response properties that can be expressed as geometric gradients of a generic linear response function, its poles, and its residues. The approach is implemented within an atomic-orbital-based formalism suitable for linear scaling at the level of self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock and density functional theory. Among the properties that can be obtained using this formalism are the gradient of the frequency-dependent polarizability (e.g., Raman intensities) and that of the one-photon transition dipole moment (entering the Herzberg-Teller factors), in addition to the excited-state molecular forces required for excited-state geometry optimizations. Geometric derivatives of ground-state first-order properties (e.g., IR intensities) and excited-state first-order property expressions are also reported as byproducts of our implementation. The one-photon transition moment gradient is the first analytic implementation of the one-photon transition moment derivative at the DFT level of theory. Besides offering a simple solution to overcome phase (hence, sign) uncertainties connected to the determination of the Herzberg-Teller corrections by numerical derivatives techniques based on independent calculations, our approach also opens the possibility to determine, for example by a mixed analytic-numerical approach, the one-photon transition dipole Hessian, and thus to investigate vibronic effects beyond the linear Herzberg-Teller approximation. As an illustrative application, we report a DFT study of the vibronic fine structure of the one-photon X(1A1g)-A(1B2u) transition in the absorption spectrum of benzene, which is Franck-Condon-forbidden in the electric dipole approximation and hence determined by the Herzberg-Teller integrals and electronic transition dipole-moment derivatives.},

Data from experimental work was used to compare with results of time-dependent Density Functional Theory involving the global hybrid B3LYP and long-range corrected LC-\omegaPBE descriptions of the exchange-correlation functional. It is shown that while reasonable simulations of the experimental absorbance spectrum can be made using B3LYP, the resonance Raman spectra for both complexes is poorly described. The LC-\omegaPBE functional gives the correct asymptotic behavior of the exchange-correlation potential and results in more accurate representations of the excited state potential energy surfaces in the Franck-Condon region for charge transfer states, as indicated by the good agreement with the experimental resonance Raman spectrum. For the carbazole/TCNE complex, which includes contributions from two overlapping excited states on its absorbance spectrum, interference effects are discussed and it is found that detuning from resonance with an excited state results in interference along with other factors.

  abstract = {The structural and electronic properties of the alizarin dye supported on TiO2 nanoclusters have been examined by means of time-dependent density-functional (TD-DFT) calculations performed in the time-domain framework. The calculated electronic absorption spectrum of free alizarin shows a first band centered at 2.67 eV that upon adsorption features a red shift by 0.31 eV, in agreement with both experimental and previous theoretical work. This red shift arises from a relative stabilization of the dye LUMO when adsorbed. To analyze the dependence of the electronic properties of the dye-support couple on the size of metal-oxide nanoparticles, different models of (TiO2)n nanoclusters have been used (with n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 38). As a conclusion, the minimal model is good enough to theoretically reproduce the main feature in the spectrum (i.e., the energy shift of the main band upon binding to TiO2). However, it fails in creating intermediate states which could play a significant role under real experimental conditions (dynamics of the electronic transfer). Indeed, as the size of the nanocluster grows, the dye LUMO moves from the edge to well inside the conduction band (Ti 3d band). On the other hand, to assess the consistency of the time-domain approach in the case of such systems, conventional (frequency-domain) TD-DFT calculations have been carried out. It is found that, as far as the functional and basis set are equivalent, both approaches lead to similar results. While for small systems the standard TD-DFT is better suited, for medium to large sized systems, the real-time TD-DFT becomes competitive and more efficient.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of the basis set dependence of the backscattering vibrational Raman intensities and Raman Optical Activity (ROA) intensity differences. The accuracies of computed Raman intensities and ROA intensity differences for a series of commonly used basis sets are reported, relative to large reference basis sets, using the B3LYP density functional. This study attempts to separately quantify the relative accuracies obtained from particular basis set combinations: one for the geometry optimization and force field computation and the other for the computation of Raman and ROA tensors. We demonstrate here that the basis set requirements for the geometry and force fields are not similar to those of the Raman and ROA tensors. The Raman and ROA tensors require basis sets with diffuse functions, while geometry optimizations and force field computations typically do not. Eleven molecules were examined: (S)-methyloxirane, (S)-methylthirane, (R)-epichlorhydrin, (S)-CHFClBr, (1S,5S)-$\alpha$-pinene, (1S,5S)-?-pinene, (1S,4S)-norborneneone, (M)-$\sigma$-[4]-helicene, an enone precursor to a cytotoxic sesquiterpene, the gauche?gauche conformer of the monosaccharide methyl-?-d-glucopyranose, and the dipeptide Ac-(alanine)2-NH2. For the molecules examined here, intensities and intensity differences obtained from Raman and ROA tensors computed using the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set are nearly equivalent to those computed with the larger aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. We find that modifying the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set by removing the set of diffuse d functions on all atoms (while keeping the diffuse s and p sets), denoted as aug(sp)-cc-pVDZ, results in a basis set which is significantly faster without much reduction in the overall accuracy. In addition, the popular rDPS basis set introduced by Zuber and Hug offers a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. The combination of either the aug(sp)-pVDZ or rDPS basis for the computation of the Raman and ROA tensors with the 6-31G* basis set for the geometry optimization and force field calculation is a reliable and cost-effective method for obtaining Raman intensities and ROA intensity differences. We present a systematic study of the basis set dependence of the backscattering vibrational Raman intensities and Raman Optical Activity (ROA) intensity differences. The accuracies of computed Raman intensities and ROA intensity differences for a series of commonly used basis sets are reported, relative to large reference basis sets, using the B3LYP density functional. This study attempts to separately quantify the relative accuracies obtained from particular basis set combinations: one for the geometry optimization and force field computation and the other for the computation of Raman and ROA tensors. We demonstrate here that the basis set requirements for the geometry and force fields are not similar to those of the Raman and ROA tensors. The Raman and ROA tensors require basis sets with diffuse functions, while geometry optimizations and force field computations typically do not.

  abstract = {In this work we have verified the remarkable sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy for the study of adsorbed pyridine on a silver surface, and extended its applicability to other nitrogen heterocycles and amines. New bands in the scattering spectrum of pyridine have been characterized, which were not previously reported, as well as the Raman intensity response of all the surface pyridine bands as a function of electrode potential. As a result of these experiments, we have proposed a model of the adsorbed species for pyridine in which the adsorption is anion induced, leading to an axial end-on attachment to the electrode surface. The ability to obtain resonance Raman spectra with good signal-to-noise with laser powers less than 1.0 mW, reported here for the first time, opens up possibilities of surface Raman studies with relatively inexpensive laser systems. As laser power requirements are relaxed, reliability is improved, and greater tuning ranges can be achieved for wavelength dependent studies. We previously demonstrated the potential of resonance Raman spectroscopy for monitoring solution kinetic behavior [2], and now have shown that NR as well as RR spectroscopy has sufficient sensitivity to extend the studies of kinetic processes to include those occurring at electrode surfaces.},

In this work, the multi-level fast multipole algorithm is used to compute the matrix-vector product in the iterative methods. This algorithm has O(N) complexity and thus makes it feasible to solve hundreds of thousands of unknowns. Different formulas that has been proposed in the literature for determining the dipole polarizabilities in the discrete dipole approximation are compared.

  abstract = {Two-photon excitation spectra of xanthene dyes in ethanol were measured by observing fluorescence emission after excitation by light with wavelengths from 780 to 1260 nm. The normalized spectra showed large two-photon induced fluorescence at higher energies and two moderate peaks near the one-photon absorption band. These features agreed well with the two-photon excitation spectra reported by other authors. The peaks near the one-photon absorption band may be due to a two-photon allowed state overlapping the lowest singlet state or to excitation to the lowest singlet state. We believe the latter is the case; while a two-photon excitation is formally symmetry forbidden, both interaction with the counterion in solution as well as vibronic coupling will remove the symmetry, allowing this transition. Comparison of the spectra of dyes with slightly different structures supports this explanation. The input power dependence of fluorescence irradiance was also measured and some deviation from the expected quadratic dependence was observed in Rhodamine 6G and Rhodamine B.},

  abstract = {A simpler identification method of tyrosine in the presence of tryptophan using CdS nanoparticles by conventional spectroscopic technique is proposed. Effect of both sulfide-enriched CdS as well as Cd2+-enriched CdS on tryptophan is investigated through absorption and emission spectroscopy. Quenching of tryptophan emission obeyed Stern-Volmer relation and was found to be independent of temperature, indicating a possible static quenching. The time-resolved fluorescence decay of tryptophan was minimally affected by sulfide-enriched CdS as well as Cd2+-enriched CdS nanoparticles, suggesting quenching to be static. In the presence of Cd2+-enriched CdS nanoparticles, the emission of tryptophan in phosphate buffer shows a typical spectral broadening along with a long wavelength increase in fluorescence emission. Additionally, spectra followed a typical isoemissive point at 440 nm when tryptophan alone was there. Similarly, isoemissive point at 340 nm was observed in the case of tyrosine. However, a further red shift of isoemissive point (470 nm) in the mixture of both tyrosine and tryptophan was observed. This observation might make Cd2+-enriched CdS nanoparticles useful for using as marker for tyrosine in the presence of tyrptophan.},

While many of these methods strive to co-nucleate both elements by exploiting fast reduction kinetics or co-sequestration within a confined space, we show here that simple room-temperature borohydride co-reduction of appropriate aqueous metal salt solutions yields alloy nanoparticles in the bulk-immiscible Au-Rh, Au-Pt, Pt-Rh, and Pd-Rh systems. The compositions can be tuned across the entire Au1-xRhx, Au1-xPtx, Pt1-xRhx, and Pd1-xRhx solid solutions by varying the ratio of metal salt reagents, and they form in the presence of a variety of molecular and polymeric surface stabilizers. Reaction pathway studies on the model Au-Rh system suggest that the alloy nanoparticles form via a "conversion chemistry" mechanism: Au nanoparticle templates nucleate first, followed by diffusion of Rh to form homogeneous Au-Rh alloy nanoparticles. The alloy nanoparticles tend to be agglomerated, but this can be minimized by forming the nanoparticles directly on catalytically relevant high surface area carbon and biological supports, e.g. Vulcan carbon and wild-type M13 bacteriophage.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced infrared absorption-reflectance (SEIRA) microspectroscopy is potentially a useful chemical/biological probe to provide insights into the localization of living endolithic bacteria on the surfaces of geologic materials. This hypothesis was tested by validating and demonstrating the use of SEIRA with a metal-overlayer configuration to identify qualitatively on vesicular basalt surfaces the highly localized differences in the chemical composition and in the structure of clusters of endolithic bacteria, vesicles, and minerals. The metal-overlayer configuration was achieved by evaporating a thin gold-film on basalt specimen surfaces. Fourier-transform SEIRA microspectra of the specimen surfaces were recorded in the 650-4000 cm-1 infrared region at a resolution of 4 cm-1 on a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer coupled to an infrared microscope. All bacteria-inhabiting surfaces exhibited infrared absorption bands indicative of bacterial cells, bands that became ideal biomarkers by which to detect the presence of bacteria. All basalt surfaces exhibited infrared absorption bands indicative of silicates, bands that became ideal mineral markers by which to detect the presence of silicate-containing minerals and locations of vesicles (gas-bubble cavities). Comparative analysis of space-resolved microspectra suggested that bacteria in the vesicular basalt lived not only on the vesicle surface but that they also penetrated and lived beneath the vesicle surface. The penetration terminated when calcic-plagioclase feldspar became the dominant constituent mineral in the vesicular basalt. With this experimental effort, the practical aspects and the usefulness of SEIRA as a promising tool to complement existing techniques for studying the in-situ localization of living bacteria in geologic materials have been demonstrated.},

Expansion in spherical harmonics of the original FMM is replaced by expansion of polynomials in Cartesian coordinates, which is considerably simpler. Under open boundary conditions, an expression for multipole moments of point dipoles in a cell is derived. These make the program appropriate for nanomagnetic simulations, including magnetic nanoparticles and ferrofluids. The performance is optimized in terms of cell size and parameter set (expansion order and opening angle) and the trade off between computing time and accuracy is quantitatively studied. A rule of thumb is proposed to decide the appropriate average number of dipoles in the smallest cells, and an optimal choice of parameter set is suggested. Finally, the superiority of Cartesian coordinate FMM is demonstrated by comparison to spherical harmonics FMM and FFT.},

Numerous transitions are evident in both the IR and Raman spectra, with the resonance Raman spectrum of HBDI dominated by a subset of transitions in the 1430-1700 cm-1 region. Assignment of the transitions in this frequency region to the corresponding normal coordinates is accomplished through computational studies employing density functional and Hartree-Fock theory. The computational results indicate that the vibrational transitions in this frequency range are dominated by in-plane stretching modes that are localized to the imidazolinone or tyrosine portions of the chromophore, rather than being delocalized over the entire chromophore. No evidence is obtained for significant excited-state structural evolution along the O-H stretching coordinate. The implications of these findings with respect to the excited-state proton transfer dynamics of GFP are discussed.},

  abstract = {The non-linear response (second harmonic generation, SHG, hyper-Rayleigh scattering, HRS, surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering, SEHRS, and continuum generation) of two different types of silver colloids is compared by stationary and correlation spectroscopy. Employing a poly-disperse colloid prepared after the protocol of Lee and Meisel we found that the efficiency of all types of non-linear response is greatly enhanced if the colloid is `activated' by addition of chloride ions. This activation is also necessary to observe SEHRS with both the Lee-Meisel and the mono-disperse colloid prepared by hydrazine reduction. The correlation curves of both types of colloid show one step ($\tau$1/2not, vert, similar10 ms) which can be associated with lateral diffusion of the individual particles. Its $\tau$1/2-value is larger for the poly-disperse colloid, which contains larger particles. In addition, we find a second step, its relative amplitude being dependent on experimental parameters, whose $\tau$1/2-value is, however, essentially the same for all samples investigated ($\tau$′1/2not, vert, similar50 $\mu$s). We assign this correlation time to processes that lead to a restructuring of the surface and the formation and destruction of so-called `hot spots'. Under optimum condition, the efficiency for all non-linear processes connected with one such `hot spot' is extremely high. `Hot particles' contain at least one hot spot and can therefore dominate the non-linear signal without the need of aggregation (field enhancement in the gap between particles).},

Geometry optimizations of excited states are performed with two closely related restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham methods and within linear response to time-dependent density functional theory. The results are compared to wave-function based methods. Excitation energies (vertical and adiabatic) calculated from the open-shell methods show systematic errors depending on the type of excitation. However, for all states accessible by the restricted methods a good agreement for the geometries with time-dependent density functional theory and wave-function based methods is found. An analysis of the energy with respect to the mixing angle for the singly occupied orbitals reveals that some states (mostly [n-->[pi]*]) are stable when symmetry constraints are relaxed and others (mostly [[pi]-->[pi]*]) are instable. This has major implications on the applicability of the restricted open-shell methods in molecular dynamics simulations.},

Thermal decomposition of polyaromatic compounds is important to understand the oils thermal cracking in geological reservoirs. Pyrolysis experiments and simulation provided useful information on the different mechanistic pathways prevailing at the low and high conditions. Using ReaxFF, a reactive simulation of 20 1-MNa was performed at 3800 K. The main molecules and radicals formed have been analyzed. The yield of molecular hydrogen was notably high compared with that experimentally found. Simulation of 1-MNa and radicals, hydrogen atoms or methylnaphthyl radicals, were also studied to enhance reactivity at lower T. In parallel, DFT calculations with B3LYP and BH\&HLYP functionals were performed on the elementary processes that may occur preferentially at low or high-temperature and the rate constant of these elementary reactions were determined using Transition State Theory. These results were in good agreement with the ReaxFF results. Preferential initiation reactions at high-temperature were also investigated through the estimation of the global activation energy accounting for 1-MNa thermal cracking with the use of ReaxFF. Again, results obtained with ReaxFF were in good agreement with experiments and DFT studies.},

Additionally, the Cr-N and Cr-C bonds were characterized on the basis of Atoms in Molecules topological analysis of electron density. It has been found that the substituents in position 4 of the pyridine ring influence the Cr-N bond of Cr(CO)(5)-Pyridine complex in a systematic manner, as a result of with, the pyridine moiety has a diversified ability of participating in the interaction with the Cr atom of Cr(CO)(5) moiety. It has also been found, that the electron withdrawing substituents additionally stabilize the Cr-N bond, whereas the electron donating ones weaken it. The substituent effect mainly affects the pi-component of the Cr-N bond.

  abstract = {It is well known that the classical optical properties of a bare or metal-film-coated dielectric surface significantly perturb the emission pattern of a fluorophore in close proximity to it. Most previous classical calculations of this effect model the fluorophore as a continuous fixed-amplitude dipole acting as a simple radiator. However, for modeling steady-state excitation, a fixed-power dipole is more appropriate. This modification corresponds to normalizing fixed-amplitude dipole intensities by the total dissipated power, which is itself dependent on fluorophore orientation and proximity to the surface. The results for the fixed-power model differ nontrivially from the fixed-amplitude model. Using the fixed-power dipole model, we calculate the observation-angle-dependent intensity as a function of the fluorophore's orientation and distance from the surface. The surface can have an intermediate layer of arbitrary thickness on it, which is used to model a metal-film-coated dielectric. In addition, general expressions are derived for the emission power as observed through a circular-aperture collection system (such as a microscope objective) located on either side of the interface. These expressions are applied to several common cases of fluorophore spatial and orientational distributions at bare glass-water and metal-film-coated glass-water interfaces. The results suggest practical experimental approaches for measuring the spatial and orientational distribution of fluorophores adsorbed at a surface, utilizing the distance-dependent fluorescence quenching near a metalized surface and optimizing the collection efficiency from a well-defined volume near a surface.},

From the point of view that the transverse and the longitudinal self-field contributions to the electromagnetic propagator dominate the electrodynamics of the quantum particles, the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the optical polarizability are investigated. In the regime of dominating paramagnetic coupling it is demonstrated that the basic vectorial integral equation can be solved exactly if a limited number of energy levels participate in the dynamics. A new and computationally simple expression is obtained for the diamagnetic polarizability with the transverse self-field assumed to dominate the interaction.

  abstract = {We performed a comprehensive experimental investigation of two-photon absorption (2PA) spectra of a series of 12 symmetrical and asymmetrical cationic polymethine dyes, including complete one-and two-photon excitation anisotropy measurements. Quantum-chemical calculations were performed with the goal of understanding the nature of 2PA bands and of uncovering structure-property relations. We found that there are 2PA bands in the spectral region between the first absorption band and that for twice its energy. A weakly allowed 2PA band within the short-wavelength shoulder of the first absorption band was observed owing to the effects of vibrational and charge distribution symmetry breaking. The nature of the strongest 2PA band is connected to the electron transition from the molecular orbital localized at the benzene rings of the terminal groups to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Structure-property relations revealed that the 2PA cross section tends to be enhanced by either an increase in the length of the polymethine chromophore or an increase in the donor strengths in the terminal groups.},

Degenerate 2PA spectra of these molecules are taken by using two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy and the Z-scan technique. All measurements are made with 150 fs laser pulses of 1 kHz repetition rate in the tuning range of 520-2100 nm(0.6-2.4 eV). Comparing 2PA spectra of polymethines and squaraines, we find that we can access considerably larger 2PA cross sections (≥8600\texttimes10−50 cm4s/photon) in the squaraines owing to narrower linear absorption spectra and an increase in the density of unoccupied molecular orbitals introduced by the squaraine acceptor group in the conjugated chain.},

Large nonlinear absorption was found in the short-wavelength region (420-460nm). The optical limiting properties of CS2 were also studied, and results showed that CS2 has good optical limiting capability in the 420-460nm region. The mechanism of the nonlinear absorption was analyzed by the temporal profile of pulses going through CS2. The large nonlinear absorption is believed to arise from a combination of two-photon absorption and the excited-state absorption induced by two-photon absorption.},

We present a quantitative model of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-background ratio (SBR) when 2PA-induced photochromic switching is used for writing, and 2PA-induced fluorescence is used for readout. We show that single-channel data access rate >100 MHz at minimum SNR>4 implies minimum intrinsic 2PA cross section, sigma2>10^3GM. Resonance enhancement allows sigma2∼10^5GM, however, it also lowers SBR due to thermally-activated one-photon absorption. We model the critical trade-off between SNR and SBR as a function of laser frequency, intensity, and temperature. Acceptable parameter space may be achieved by careful choice of the above variables. We perform experiments with nonsymmetrical free-base phthalocyanines, which show efficient 2PA-induced photochromic switching between two tautomer forms and large sigma2∼10^4GM, and show good potential for high-capacity data storage.},

A general analytical expression is derived for the kernel, which is non-separable in the radial variables. With the help of series expansions a separable approximate form is proposed, which is in close analogy with the conventional multipole expansion of the Coulomb kernel in spherical harmonics. The convergence behaviour of these expansions is studied and illustrated by the electrostatic potential of an elementary charge distribution formed by products of Slater-type atomic orbitals.},

A totally different expression has been proposed recently, behaving like (d 2 ) omega 3 log( omega z); it can emerge from some calculations on a two-level atomic model. One reason is an unrepresentative cancellation, peculiar to the model, between leading terms in the shifts of the two levels. A deeper failure of the model is its inconsistency with basic quantum mechanics, in that the upper level cannot obey the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule, allowing results to depend on just how the calculation is performed.},

Extension of this method of thermal effect management with an optical chopper to emission studies also results in good correspondence for two-photon cross-section measurements from either z -scan or two-photon fluorescence techniques.

Franck-Condon factors for the C-O stretching vibration were calculated by using Morse oscillator wave functions since the harmonic approximation and the method of Doktorov, Malkin, and Man'ko proved to be inadequate. We report a consistent set of intensities of false origins for each molecule which gave a good fit to the spectrum. The oscillator strength of the band is (2.40 f 0.05) X lo-' in H2C0 and (1.86 f 0.05) X in D2C0. We find for H2C0 that of this intensity about 66% is induced by vibration u4, 26% by u5, 6% by Vg, and 0.5% by each of the combinations u4u5 and V4V6; about 1% is due to the magnetic-dipole-allowed component. We discuss a new way of considering vibronic intensity induced by two or more vibrations of the same symmetry. In the case of u5 and u5, we show that the intensity is induced by displacing the H atoms in a direction nearly perpendicular to the C-0 bond, while displacement parallel to that bond induces virtually no intensity.},

We discuss briefly some experimental tools, in particular, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and present experimental illustrations of rotational, vibrational, and electronic excitations of adsorbates. For excitations at surfaces, new effective nonradiative decay paths are opened involving, for example, excitation of electron-hole pairs and phonons. For excited molecules not in direct contact with the metal substrate (or where this overlap can be neglected), the nonradiative quenching can only result from the interaction between the oscillating electric field of the excited molecule and the metal. We first discuss the "classical theory" of this coupling and point out its limitations. We then present an improved theory and compare its predictions with experimental data. For excited molecules in direct contact with the substrate, electron transfer between the molecule and the metal can often occur, and this leads in general to strongly nonadiabatic processes. We illustrate this type of decay path for both vibrational and electronic excitations. Finally, multiphonon and phase relaxation of vibrations at surfaces are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) of rhodamine 6G (R6G) adsorbed on colloidal silver was studied. Adsorption isotherms could be obtained from SERRS and fluorescent measurements. Two different kinds of adsorption sites were inferred from the isotherms. One kind is rather unspecific and shows a high surface coverage. The enhancement factor at such sites is 3000, which can be well explained by the classical electromagnetic theory of colloids. The second kind is only observed in the presence of anions (Cl-, I-, Br-, F, SO:-). Specific active sites are formed at an extremely low surface coverage. It was concluded from the isotherms that at such sites the molecules are chemisorbed. Overall enhancement factors up to lo6 were found for molecules at anion-activated sites. The additional enhancement factor is ascribed to a local mechanism of an R6G-adatom (or cluster)-anion surface complex. SERRS excitation profiles of active sites are closely related to the molecular resonance at 530 nm. SERRS spectra of R6G were recorded and analyzed in a wide frequency range. The two adsorption sites could be distinguished by characteristic vibrational features. It was demonstrated that SERRS is also a powerful analytical tool for dye molecules.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra were measured for 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) adsorbed on Ag colloids. As the pH of the colloidal solution was altered from 8.5 to 2.8 with HCI, the SERS spectra of bpy showed drastic changes in their features, indicating that the adsorbed bpy molecules on Ag colloids are of two different types. One type of adsorbate, which can be found throughout the entire pH range 8.5-2.8, was identified as type I species already observed for the bpy/KCl/Ag electrode system. This species takes on a coplanar cis conformation and a molecular state almost identical with that of an argentous complex such as Agi(bpy),N03. In the presence of either the I- ion or the C1- and Br- ions in acidic solutions with pH lower than 4.0, the other type of adsorbate, which is characterized by the SERS band at 1025 cm-I, appears; the intensity increases with lowering the pH of the colloidal solution. This adsorbate has an identical spectroscopic feature with that of the type 111 species found for the Ag electrode system. Further studies on the effect of both the pH and coexisting anions such as C1-, Br-, I-, and S042- on the formation of type 111 species reveal that, in this species, one of the halide ions and a bpy molecule adsorb together to a positively charged site (or adatom) on the colloidal surface, forming a strongly chemisorbed surface complex.},

  abstract = {An accurate but simple method for determining electromagnetic fields near the surfaces of small metal spheroidal particles has been used to determine field and Raman enhancements for 10 metals in groups 1, 11, 12, and 13. This method corrects the simple small particle Laplace electrostatic field for electrodynamic depolarization and damping effects to give a result which is equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations to order k^3 (k = 2\pi/\lambda), and it also incorporates size-dependent plasmon broadening effects which arise from small particle surface scattering of the conduction electrons. With this method we have studied the dependence of both field and Raman enhancement factors on particle size and shape, and from this we have determined optimal sizes, shapes, excitation frequencies, and enhancement factors for each metal. Comparisons with experiment are given where possible. Our results for the noble metals are in accord with the observed frequency dependence of SERS for Ag, Au, and Cu, but the optimized peak enhancements are still well below (factor of 101-102) experimental enhancement estimates. Enhancements for the alkalis are comparable to those for the noble metals, but with a flatter dependence on frequency in the visible region, and with different optimum particle sizes and shapes. Al and In are found to give large enhancements over a broad region of the spectrum (IR - UV) but Ga only gives large enhancements in the IR. The size and shape dependences of the enhancements for the group 13 metals show great variation with metal and with frequency. Cd is found to exhibit relatively small electromagnetic enhancements in the visible and near-UV regions, while Zn has windows of significant enhancement at 2.5 and 3.5 eV.},

  abstract = {A correlation function formulation, based on the Liouville equation for the density matrix, provides a microscopic theory for solvation dynamics and establishes a general fundamental connection between the calculation of rate processes and nonlinear optical processes in solution. The present rate theory requires the calculation of four-point correlation functions of the nonadiabatic coupling, which is formally identical with the calculation of four-wave-mixing processes and the nonlinear susceptibility \chi^{(3)}. A novel semiclassical propagation scheme (the Liouville-space generating function, LGF) is developed and used in these calculations. The connection with \chi^{(3)}may allow the direct use of solvent correlation functions obtained from nonlinear optical measurements, in the calculation of molecular rate processes. The present theory interpolates continuously from the adiabatic to the nonadiabatic limits. A new criterion for adiabaticity is derived, and the role of the solvent time scale in inducing the crossover from the nonadiabatic to the adiabatic regimes is clarified. The present results generalize the Kramers theory of isomerization and the Marcus theory of electron transfer in polar solvents. Both static (polarity) interactions, which affect the reaction energetics and dynamic (friction) effects, are properly incorporated.},

A simple approximate expression is obtained for the full width at half-maximum for the kET and spectral plots and is tested using recent numerical results for calculated k^{ET} vs -\DeltaG^O curves. Studies of experimental widths of CT bands are used, thereby, to test ideas on the possible presence and effects of partial dielectric saturation and on the observation of the inverted region.

  abstract = {A unified dynamical theory of rate processes such as electron transfer in solution, which interpolates between the nonadiabatic and the adiabatic limits, is presented. The theory is based on expanding the rate perturbatively to fourth order in the nonadiabatic coupling V using the density matrix in Liouville space and performing a partial resummation. The present theory establishes a profound connection between rate theories and nonlinear optical spectroscopies. The rate to order V^2 is related to linear optics and the linear susceptibility \chi^{(1)}. The rate to order V^4 is related to the third-order susceptibility \chi^{(3)}. This connection arises since the same dephasing mechanisms which affect the optical line shapes also control the dynamics of rate processes. The frequency-dependent reaction rate is calculated and the dielectric continuum model for polar solvation is extended to incorporate the microscopic solvation structure via the wave vector and frequency dependent dielectric function \epsilon(k,\omega).},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been used to study different kinds of surfactants (cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants) adsorbed on a roughened Ag electrode. Spectral assignments are made for the SERS spectrum of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and it is shown that the molecule is oriented with its pyridinium ring end-on at the electrode surface at potentials positive to the point of zero charge (pzc) on Ag. Another cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, shows a weaker SERS spectrum than CPC; however, its spectrum indicates a ``solidlike'' hydrocarbon chain region near the head-group layer for spectra measured at potentials positive to the pzc. The solidlike structure is a region of extended hydrocarbon chain which is in the ail-trans configuration. The interactions between the Ag surface and the various kinds of surfactants are found to depend on the charge and type of head group, however; both the cationic and nonionic surfactants studied have a head-on orientation at potentials positive to the pzc. It has also been found that these cationic and nonionic surfactants show an unexpected enhancement for C-H stretching modes at potentials more negative than ca. -0.8 V vs SCE with a concurrent development of two new SERS vibrational bands at 2710 and 2815 cm-1 in the C-H stretching region.},

  abstract = {Electronic and chemical changes in CS_{2} shocked to 20 GPa have been examined by using time-resolved absorption measurements. Experiments were carried out on thin samples (\approx 1 \mu\m) to provide good resolution of the absorption spectrum between 280 and 500 nm in pure CS_{2} and to separate pressure, temperature, and time effects. In addition to the V-band existing at ambient conditions, a new band is observed on the red side of the V-band at high pressures. Unlike the V-band, the peak position and intensity of the new band vary substantially with pressure and temperature. The new band shows a "hot" band character and is conjectured to be the T-band resulting from a transition to the ^{1}A_{2} state. The edge shifts of the absorption band, at a given pressure, decrease with decreasing temperature. The time-dependent increase in absorbance and the magnitude of the edge shifts cannot be reconciled with temperature changes and are believed to represent changes in the electronic structure due to diffusive molecular motions. Spectral changes are irreversible above 11-12 GPa due to a shock-induced chemical reaction. The absorption changes from this and previous work suggest that an associative type of chemical reaction occurs in shocked CS_{2}.},

  abstract = {We have studied the infrared transmission spectra of thin organic films of p-nitrobenzoic acid deposited on silver island films evaporated on CaF2 The absorption of the molecule is enhanced remarkably by the presence of silver island films. When mass thickness of the silver film is very small, the enhancement is restricted only to the molecule adsorbed directly onto the silver surface. As the mass thickness increases, the absorption intensity of the chemisorbed molecule increases and, in addition, the absorption of the molecules that were condensed over the chemisorbed molecule becomes to be enhanced. The largest enhancement factor is 500-600 for the chemisorbed molecule and is 20-30 for the overlayer. It has been suggested that the enhancement of electromagnetic field and the increase in vibrational polarizabilities of the molecule caused by a chemical interaction with the metal surface contribute independently to the absorption enhancement. Orientation of the chemisorbed molecule provides further additional small enhancement. The observed quite large enhancement is explained by a product of these three contributions.},

The depolarization ratios exhibit only a weak dependence on the vibrational quantum number of the a] methyl iodide stretching mode (v3) in contrast to previous analysis of the resonance Raman spectrum. Furthermore, all u3 vibrational bands exhibit anomalously large depolarization ratios. This depolarization is largely attributed to a simple interference between parallel and perpendicularly polarized sources of Raman scattering amplitude. Only \Delta K = 0 scattering transitions are considered in this analysis as required by angular momentum constraints appropriate to totally symmetric vibrational Raman transitions. The polarization characteristics and rovibrational band contours are consistent with this two-state interference model. The contribution of curve crossing dynamics is not seen to play a large role in determining the nature of the scattering emission of methyl iodide at 266-nm excitation.},

For alkanes the best fit is obtained with vanishing atom monopole polarizabilities; i.e., for the model in which no atom charge transfer occurs. For the planar aromatic molecules the best fit is obtained by a model which includes both monopole and dipole atom polarizabilities for the horizontal (in-plane) components and only dipole polarizabilities in the vertical (out-of-plane) components. Only the ring carbon atoms have nonzero monopole polarizabilities in this model. The vertical polarizabilities are treated by an approximation which neglects dipole coupling among atoms in the same conjugated system in order to overcome a violation of energy conservation when dipole coupling is included. The parameters so obtained are used to calculate polarizability tensors for an additional 12 aromatic hydrocarbons, including methylbenzenes and polycyclic aromatic compounds. The calculated mean polarizabilities and anisotropies lie within the ranges of available experimental data in all cases, and the relative magnitudes of principal polarizability components agree with those assigned from experimental data.},

  abstract = {A theoretical description of femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy of isolated polyatomic molecules is outlined. Our ultimate goal is the characterization of the system response on a microscopic level, that is, time-dependent quantum dynamics. Employing a simplified model Hamiltonian which includes themost relevant electronic states and vibrational modes, the intramolecular quantum dynamics is treated numerically exactly. The model Hamiltonian is constructed, via a Taylor expansion in terms of ground-state normal coordinates, from ab initio potential-energy surfaces. Additional phase relaxation effects (optical pure dephasing) due to weakly coupled modes have been included in a phenomenological manner using the density-matrix formalism. The radiation-matter interaction, derived from ab initio transition-dipole-moment functions, is treated in perturbation theory (up to third order for the polarization). The implementation of this approach is demonstrated for the Sz(m*) state of pyrazine, which is strongly vibronically coupled to the lower-lying Sl(nr*) state. Basic aspects of ultrafast non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics on multidimensional conically intersecting potential energy surfaces and its detection by femtosecond pumpprobe spectroscopy are discussed.},

  abstract = {A theoretical description of a new experimental technique related to the fifth-order optical nonlinearity of a chromophore in condensed media is presented. Three optical pulses are used to create three consecutive electronic coherence states the duration of the first two of which are controlled. Four nonlinear response functions representative of the full set of 16 response functions are calculated. The wave vectors associated with these four nonlinear response functions are given by k1, 2k3 - k1, 2k3 - 2k2 + k1, and 2k2 - k1. We consider a Gaussian function for the inhomogeneous distribution of electronic transition energies and express the fifth-order three pulse scattering (FOTS) signals in terms of homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions. If the two delay times controlling the coherence periods are set equal, the "diagonal" signal appearing with wave vector 2k3 - 2k2 + k1 allows a clean separation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening for a Markovian line broadening function with arbitrary inhomogeneous width. For non-Markovian line broadening functions, the diagonal FOTS signal is free of short-time distortion from the Gaussian components, but in this case, both diagonal and off-diagonal (i.e. unequal delay times) signals must be measured to obtain the homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions. We illustrate the results in the Markovian limit and provide a preliminary discussion of the situation for non-Markovian line broadening functions. The short-time behavior is discussed and a more general model in which the bath is described as a set of harmonic oscillators characterized by a spectral density is outlined.},

  abstract = {One- and two-photon absorption spectra (OPA and TPA) and polarizabilities of ethylene, trans-butadiene, trans-hexatriene, and trans-octatetraene are investigated by means of linear and quadratic response theory calculations. It is demonstrated that accurate results for the one-photon excitation spectra of these short polyenes can be obtained already at the lowest level of response theory, namely, the random phase approximation (RPA). The excellent agreement with the experimental one-photon spectra, generally within one or two tenths of an electronvolt, indicates that the comparatively simple but still well-defined RPA method has important ramifications for the study of linear optical properties of the conjugated polyenes. The polarizabilities generated by RPA are within a few percent of the vapor-phase values at the corresponding frequencies. Two-photon spectra of the short polyenes are investigated by the quadratic RPA method. Two-photon absorption maxima have been found for the even states of trans-butadiene, trans-hexatriene, and trans-octatetraene located at 1.5-1.7 E,. The first one-photon forbidden *A, state is found to have a very small two-photon amplitude and is therefore likely not to contribute significantly to the nonlinear properties of the polyenes, although it might intrude the one-photon bandgap. The mechanism of optical nonlinearity in the short conjugated polyenes is explored in relation to the so-called three- and four-state models. It is found that the validity of these models for calculations of hyperpolarizabilities of the short polyenes is rather limited.},

The QM/MM method employs the semiempirical AM1 method to describe the ethers, the MM parametrization of Dang for K+, and the MM SPC/e model for H2O. We parametrize the interaction Hamiltonian to the binding energies and optimized geometries for K+/DME using a b initio HF and MP2/6-3 1+G* results. The resulting Q W model describes the polarization response of both free DME and K+-complexed DME well. The QM/MM model gives good agreement with the experimental and ab initio structures for K+/18c6. We calculate gas-phase K+/18c6 binding energies of -70.2 and -72.0 kcallmol with the QM/MM and MP2/6-31+Gh (CP corrected) methods, respectively. Our simulation results for Kf/18c6 in H20 show that the most probable K+/18c6 center-of- mass displacement is 0.25 A, in marked contrast to previous molecular dynamics results of Dang and Kollman. Our result is consistent with K+ having an optimal ``fit'' for the cavity of 18c6. Still, we find that K+ retains significant solvent accessibility coordinating two H20 molecules, on average, in the K+/l 8c6 simulation. The simulation average polarization energy for 18c6 interacting with both K+ and the H20 solvent is -14.9 kcal/mol, which is 17% of the total electrostatic interaction energy. This result underscores the potential importance of QM in describing the solution chemistry of ion-macrocycle interactions. Our study is the first simulation of crown ethers that explicitly incorporates QM in the force field.},

  abstract = {The excited electronic states of carbon disulfide (CS2) are examined theoretically by exploiting the CIS and CIS-MP2 configuration interaction methods in conjunction with extensive sets of basis functions (e.g., 6-31++G*). At their respective equilibrium geometries, the lowest-lying states of CS2 are predicted to have symmetry labels and electronic energies given by X^1 \Sigma_g^+ < a^3B_2 < b^3A_2(R) < A^1A_2 < B^1B_2(V) < c^3B_2 < d^3A_2 < C^1A_2, where the letters in parentheses refer to established spectroscopic designations for the R and V absorption systems. The bent b^3A_2(R) and c^3B_2 states are found to correlate with a degenerate level in the linear molecule. Analogous Renner-Teller effects in the ^1\Delta_u level give rise to ^1A_2 and ^1B_2 potential surfaces, the latter of which correlates to the well-studied B^1B_2(V) state. The presence of an unexpected crossing between the ^1\Delta_u and ^1\Sigma_u^- curves of linear CS2 makes definitive assignment for the other member of this Renner-Teller doublet difficult, with an apparent reversal of relative energy ordering encountered as a function of the C-S bond distance. The implications of this effect, as well as the influence exerted by neighboring electronic manifolds (e.g., the hitherto unobserved d^3A_2 surface which supports spin-orbit allowed electric dipole transitions from the X^1\Sigma_g^+ ground state), are discussed in terms of recent studies performed on the near-ultraviolet photochemistry and photophysics of CS2. While ab initio properties predicted for the b^3A_2(R) state are in good accord with previous spectroscopic measurements, the calculated equilibrium geometry, barrier to linearity, and vibrational frequencies for the B^1B_2(V) potential surface differ significantly from experimental observations.},

Thus, a new point of view to solvation phenomena is presented, which provides an alternative access to many questions of scientific and technical importance. The whole theory is based on the results of molecular orbital continuum solvation models.

We present QM/MMpol analysis of the ground and electronic excited states of the bacteriochlorophyll b dimer (P) of the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of Rhodopseudomonas viridis using the INDO/S method. We treat P and five adjacent amino acid side chains quantum mechanically, and the remainder of the protein, cofactors, and waters of crystallization with polarizable MM (325 QM atoms embedded in the field of 20 158 polarizable MM atoms). While dimer formation alone is enough to account for the majority of the monomer BChlb to P red-shift of the lowest electronic excited state of P (QyI), we demonstrate that explicit treatment of the protein is required to properly interpret the experimental Stark effect data that describe the charge transfer asymmetry of QYl. The static-charge potential from the MM model of the RC alone causes QYI to have significantly better agreement with the Stark effect results than isolated P. However, consideration of the protein polarization potential is further required to obtain more complete agreement with Stark effect experiments. Thus, we calculate a Q,I transition energy at 10 826 cm-I with a ground to excited state change in dipole moment of 4.8 D; an absorption Stark effect angle of 43"; a net shift of 0.15 electrons from the L subunit to the M subunit of P; and a linear dichroism angle (between the transition moment of QYl and the pseudo-C* axis of the RC) of 81". These results are in good agreement with experiment. Interestingly, we find that net CT increase is greater for QYl than for the second excited state of P (Qy2), a result that we anticipated in an early model dimer study.},

  abstract = {The resonance Raman spectrum of the simple peptide N-methylacetamide (NMA) is very different in the vapor phase than when dissolved in aqueous solution. The spectrum for an acetonitrile solution is intermediate. The major difference is that the amide I mode, primarily involving C=O stretching, is very strong in the vapor-phase spectrum but very weak or absent in the aqueous solution spectrum. Since resonance Raman scattering reflects the geometry change associated with electronic excitation, this suggests that there is a large effect of solvation on the geometry of the excited electronic state. The present work describes the development of quantitative ab initio quantum chemical procedures for calculating resonance Raman spectra with application to NMA both isolated and in solution. It is shown that a simple cluster model involving hydrogen-bonding of water molecules to NMA provides an adequate description of the effect of aqueous solvation on resonance Raman spectra of NMA. The major effect appears to be due to a change in the geometry of the resonant $\pi$$\pi$* excited electronic state. However, there is also a significant change in the ground-state geometry and the form of the normal modes upon hydrogen-bonding. To fully describe this ground-state effect it is necessary (and sufficient) to treat the solvent beyond the NMA(H2O)3 cluster using a self-consistent reaction field.},

With the aim of predicting the effect of this mechanism on the selective enhancement of fundamentals, a method has been proposed based on an analysis of the results of geometry optimizations carried out by ab initio calculations. The strongest SERS bands coincide with those assigned to the normal modes connecting the equilibrium geometries of the neutral molecule and the radical anion. These results support the presence of a charge transfer process from the metal to the adsorbate in the SERS spectra of pyrazine where a significant enhancement of vibrations 8a, 9a, 1, and 6a can be observed. The prediction capability of the analysis proposed here has been checked with published resonance Raman spectra of pyrazine and pyrazine-d4. In all of the cases the strongest bands in the spectra are directly related to the largest DeltaQ values obtained through the transformation DeltaQ = L-1DeltaR. },

After a qualitative discussion of electron transfer, its time and distance scales, energy curves, and basic parabolic energy models are introduced to define the electron transfer process. Application of transition state theory leads to the standard Marcus formulation of electron transfer rate constants. Electron transfer in solution is coupled to solvent polarization effects, and relaxation processes can contribute to and even control electron transfer. The inverted region, in which electron transfer rate constants decrease with increasing exoergicity, is one of the most striking phenomena in electron transfer chemistry. It is predicted by both semiclassical and quantum mechanical models, with the latter appropriate if there are coupled high- or medium-frequency vibrations. The intramolecular reorganizational energy has different contributions from different vibrational modes, which, in favorable cases, can be measured on a mode-by-mode basis by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Alternatively, mode-averaging procedures are available for including multimode contributions based on absorption or emission spectra. Rate constants for intramolecular electron transfer depend on electronic coupling and orbital overlap and, therefore, on distance. Mixed-valence systems have provided an important experimental platform for investigating solvent and structural effects and the transition between localized and delocalized behavior. One of the important developments in electron transfer is the use of absorption and emission measurements to calculate electron transfer rate constants. Ultrafast electron transfer measurements have been used to uncover nonequilibrium relaxation effects, an area that presents special challenges to the understanding of the dynamics and relaxation of the coupled processes. Electron transfer in the gas phase offers substantial insights into the nature of the electron transfer process. Similarly, electron transport in conductive polymers and synthetic metals depends on the basic principles of electron transfer, with some special nuances of their own.},

  abstract = {Raman scattering enhancement was observed in systems where different metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2, Fe2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) were modified with enediol ligands. The intensity of Raman scattering was dependent on laser frequency and correlated with the extinction coefficient of the CT complex of the enediol ligands and nanoparticles. The mechanism of Raman enhancement was studied by varying both the chemical composition of the enediol ligand and the chemical composition (and crystal structure) of the nanoparticles. We found that the intensity of the Raman signal depends on the number of surface binding sites, electron density of the ligands, and their dipole moment. Changes in chemical composition caused variations in the intensity, frequency, and number of Raman bands observed. We also showed that Raman scattering is observed for the bioconjugated system, where a peptide is linked to the surface of the particle through a catechol linker, and further investigated the potential for such a system in the development of Raman-based in vivo and in vitro biodetection, cell labeling and imaging, and nanotherapeutic strategies.},

Well-known concepts of DFT, such as the exchangecorrelation energy Exc = rho(r) epsilonxc(r) dr and the exchangecorrelation potential vxc(r) are related to electron correlation as described in terms of density matrices and the conditional amplitude (Fermi and Coulomb holes). The KohnSham one-electron or orbital model of DFT is contrasted with HartreeFock, and the definitions of exchange and correlation in DFT are compared with the traditional ones. The exchangecorrelation energy density epsilonxc(r) is decomposed into kinetic and electronelectron potential energy components, and a practical way of calculating these from accurate wave functions is discussed, which offers a route to systematic improvement. vxc(r) is likewise decomposed, and special features (bond midpoint peak, various types of step behavior) are identified and related to electronic correlation. },

Two hundred seventeen small to medium sized neutral molecules, covering most of the chemical functionality of the elements H, C, N, O, and Cl, have been considered. An overall accuracy of 0.4 (rms) kcal/mol for chemical potential differences, corresponding to a factor of 2 in the equilibrium constants under consideration, has been achieved. This was using only a single radius and one dispersion constant per element and a total number of eight COSMO-RS inherent parameters. Most of these parameters were close to their theoretical estimate. The optimized cavity radii agreed well with the widely accepted rule of 120% of van der Waals radii. The whole parametrization was based upon density functional calculations using DMol/COSMO. As a result of this sound parametrization, we are now able to calculate almost any chemical equilibrium in liquid/liquid and vapor/liquid systems up to an accuracy of a factor 2 without the need of any additional experimental data for solutes or solvents. This opens a wide range of applications in physical chemistry and chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {A buffered tris(2,2`-bipyridyl)ruthenium complex-colloidal IrO2 system was studied as a photocatalyst for the production of O2 from water. Phosphate buffer, which has historically been used to control the pH in this system, accelerates the decomposition of the photosensitizer and inhibits O2 evolution, whereas sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6)base solutions are ideal buffers for the reaction. Na2SiF6-containing buffers poise the solution under visible light irradiation at ca. pH 5, preventing the pH drop that accompanies oxidation of water in unbuffered solutions. Decomposition of the photosensitizer is not kinetically competitive with oxygen evolution in these buffers. In particular, the Na2SiF6NaHCO3 buffer greatly improves the turnover number of the photosensitizer, relative to previously used phosphate buffers, without any decrease in activity. Photocatalytic reactions studied under various conditions suggest that adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate on the surface of the colloidal IrO2 particles contributes to the increased turnover number of the photosensitizer.},

  abstract = {The resonance Raman spectra of LDS750 in methanol-h4 and methanol-d4 have been determined at excitation wavelengths on the blue side of the absorption maximum. In contrast to our previous studies of the solvatochromic molecule betaine-30, Raman intensities of LDS750 are observed to be independent of solvent isotopomer. The fluorescence quantum yield, however, was significantly larger in methanol-d4 than in methanol-h4. The results suggest that the dephasing dynamics that determine the resonance Raman intensities are dominated by intramolecular relaxation rather than solvent motion. Excited-state population relaxation, on the other hand, is perturbed by solvent isotope and the more intense emission in deuterated solvent is a consequence of less favorable FranckCondon factors for radiationless decay. The radiative lifetime calculated from the quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime is considerably longer than that found using the StricklerBerg equation, suggesting that the transition moment in the relaxed geometry is reduced from that in the FranckCondon geometry. Our conclusions concerning excited state dynamics in LDS750 are compared with those obtained from time-domain measurements on this dye.},

  abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

Hyper-Raman excitation profiles were examined in the excitation wavelength range from 770 to 840 nm (lambda_ex/2, 385-420 nm). In this excitation range, the intensity of all the hyper-Raman bands monotonically increased with shortening excitation wavelength, and the hyper-Raman spectral feature was very similar to that of resonance Raman spectra excited with double the excitation energy (lambda_ex/2).

In the present study, density functional theory at the level of B3LYP/6-311+G{*}{*} (for C, N, H)/LANL2DZ (for metals) has been used for the normal coordinate calculations of the neutral and cationic species of the pyridine-metal atom (ion) complexes. Based on the present calculations, new assignments of the fundamental frequencies for the bands attributed to nu(17a), nu(3), nu(5), and nu(18b) modes of the free pyridine in the reported IR and Raman spectra have been suggested. The calculated frequency shifts indicate that the coupling among nu(1), nu(12), and nu(18a) modes and the coupling between these mode,, and the N-metal (Cu, Ag, Au, or Pt) bond depend on the strength of the N-metal bond and its bonding properties. The fundamental frequency of the nu6(a) mode has a nearly linear relationship with the change of the force constant of the N-M bond, Therefore, its frequency shift can be used to directly correlate to the strength of the interaction of pyridine with the metal atom (surface).},

  abstract = {The functional dependence of excited-state geometries and normal modes calculated with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is investigated on the basis of vibronic structure calculations of the absorption spectra of large molecules. For a set of molecules covering a wide range of different structures including organic dyes, biological chromophores, and molecules of importance in material science, quantum mechanical simulations of the vibronic structure are performed. In total over 40 singlet\^asinglet transitions of neutral closed-shell compounds and doublet\^adoublet transitions of neutral radicals, radical cations, and anions are considered. Calculations with different standard density functionals show that the predicted vibronic structure critically depends on the fraction of the \^aexact\^a Hartree\^aFock exchange (EEX) included in hybrid functionals. The effect can been traced back to a large influence of EEX on the geometrical displacement upon excitation. On the contrary, the dependence of the results on the choice of the local exchange-correlation functional is found to be rather small. On the basis of detailed comparisons with experimental spectra conclusions are drawn concerning the optimum amount of EEX mixing for a proper description of the excited-state properties. The relationship of the quality of the simulated spectra with the errors for 0\^a0 transition energies is discussed. For the investigated singlet\^asinglet \"I \^a \"I* transitions and the first strongly dipole-allowed transitions of PAH radical cations some rules of thumb concerning the optimum portion of EEX are derived. However, in general no universal amount of EEX seems to exist that gives a uniformly good description for all systems and states. Nevertheless an inclusion of about 30\^a40% of EEX in the functional is found empirically to yield in most cases simulated spectra that compare very well with those from experiment and thus seems to be necessary for an accurate description of the excited-state geometry. Pure density functionals that are computationally more efficient provide less accurate spectra in most cases and their application is recommended solely for comparison purposes to obtain estimates for the reliability of the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {With the aim of developing a computationally inexpensive method for modeling the high-temperature reaction dynamics of transition metal catalyzed reactions we have developed a ReaxFF reactive force field in which the parameters are fitted to a substantial quantum mechanics (QM) training set, containing full reaction pathways for relevant reactions. In this paper we apply this approach to reactions involving carbon materials plus Co, Ni, and Cu atoms. We find that ReaxFF reproduces the QM reaction data with good accuracy while also reproducing the binding characteristics of Co, Ni, and Cu atoms to hydrocarbon fragments. To demonstrate the applicability of ReaxFF we performed high-temperature (1500 K) molecular dynamics simulations on a nonbranched all-carbon feedstock in the presence and absence of Co, Ni, and Cu atoms. We find that the presence of Co and Ni leads to substantial amounts of branched carbon atoms, leading eventually to the formation of carbon-nanotube-like species. In contrast, we find that under the same simulation conditions Cu leads to very little branching and leads to products with no nanotube character. In the absence of metals no branching is observed at all. These results suggest that Ni and Co catalyze the production of nanotube-like species whereas Cu does not. This is in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that ReaxFF can provide a useful and computational tractable tool for studying the dynamics of transition metal catalytic chemistry.},

  abstract = {The UV absorption spectrum of the permanganate anion is a prototype transition-metal complex spectrum. Despite this being a simple d0 Td system, for which a beautiful spectrum with detailed vibrational structure has been available since 1967, the assignment of the second and third bands is still very controversial. The issue can be resolved only by an elucidation of the intricate vibronic structure of the spectrum. We investigate the vibronic coupling by means of linear-response time-dependent density functional calculations. By means of a diabatizing scheme that employs the transition densities obtained in the TDDFT calculations in many geometries around Re, we construct a Taylor series expansion in the normal coordinates of a diabatic potential energy matrix, coupling 24 excited states. The simulated vibronic structure is in good agreement with the experimental absorption spectrum after the adjustment of some of the calculated vertical excitation energies. The peculiar blurred vibronic structure of the second band, which is a very distinctive feature of the experimental spectrum, is fully reproduced in the calculations. It is caused by the double-well shape of the adiabatic energy surface along the Jahn-Teller active e mode of the allowed 1E state arising from the second 1T2 state, which exhibits a Jahn-Teller splitting into 1B2 and 1E states. We trace the double-well shape to an avoided crossing between two diabatic states with different orbital-excitation character. The crossing can be explained at the molecular orbital level from the Jahn-Teller splitting of the set of 7t2{3dxy, 3dxz, 3dyz} orbitals (the LUMO + 1), to which the excitations characterizing the diabatic states take place. In contrast to its character in the two well regions, at Re the 21T2 state is not predominantly an excitation to the LUMO + 1, but has more HOMO-1-LUMO (2e = {3dx2-y2, 3dz2}) character. The changing character of the 21T2 - 1E state along the e mode implies that the assignment of the experimental bands to single orbital transitions is too simplistic intrinsically. This spectrum, and notably the blurring of the vibronic structure in the second band, can be understood only from the extensive configurational mixing and vibronic coupling between the excited states. This solves the long-standing assignment problem of these bands.},

These wavelengths span the strong visible to near-UV linear absorption spectrum, which appears to involve at least three different electronic transitions. The relative intensities of different vibrational bands vary considerably across the excitation spectrum, with the hyper-Raman spectra showing greater variation than the linear Raman. A previously derived theory of resonance hyper-Raman intensities is modified to include contributions from purely vibrational levels of the ground electronic state as intermediate states in the two-photon absorption process. These contributions are found to have only a slight effect on the hyper-Rayleigh intensities and profiles, but they significantly influence some of the hyper-Raman profiles. The absorption spectrum and the Raman, hyper-Rayleigh, and hyper-Raman excitation profiles are quantitatively simulated under the assumption that three excited electronic states contribute to the one- and two-photon absorption in this region. The transition centered near 400 nm is largely localized on the nitrophenyl group, while the transitions near 475 and 355 nm are more delocalized.},

  abstract = {Electronic spectroscopy of nine benzannelated enediynes and a related fulvene was studied under one-photon and two-photon excitation conditions. We utilize measured absorbance and emission spectra and time-resolved fluorescence decays of these molecules to calculate their radiative lifetimes and fluorescence quantum yields. The fluorescence quantum yields for the other compounds were referenced to the fluorescence quantum yield of compound 3 and used to determine relative two-photon absorption cross-sections. Further insight into experimental studies has been achieved using time-dependent density functional (TD-DFT) computations. The probability of two-photon absorption (TPA) increases noticeably for excitation to the higher excited states. The photophysical properties of benzannelated enediynes are sensitive to substitutions at both the core and the periphery of the enediyne chromophore. Considerably enhanced two-photon absorption is observed in an enediyne with donor substitution in the middle and acceptor substitution at the termini. Excited states with B symmetry are not active in TPA spectra. From a practical point of view, this study extends the range of wavelengths applicable for activation of the enediyne moiety from 350 to 600 nm and provides a rational basis for future studies in this field. Our theoretical computations confirmed that lowest energy TPA in benzannelated enediynes involves different orbitals than lowest energy one-photon absorbance and provided further support to the notion that introduction of donor and acceptor substituents at different ends of a molecule increases TPA.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present the first calculation of the resonance Raman scattering (RRS) spectrum of rhodamine 6G (R6G) which is a prototype molecule in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The calculation is done using a recently developed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method, which uses a short-time approximation to evaluate the Raman scattering cross section. The normal Raman spectrum calculated with this method is in good agreement with experimental results. The calculated RRS spectrum shows qualitative agreement with SERS results at a wavelength that corresponds to excitation of the S-1 state, but there are significant differences with the measured RRS spectrum at wavelengths that correspond to excitation of the vibronic sideband of S-1. Although the agreement with the experiments is not perfect, the results provide insight into the RRS spectrum of R6G at wavelengths close to the absorption maximum where experiments are hindered due to strong fluorescence. The calculated resonance enhancements are found to be on the order of 10(5). This indicates that a surface enhancement factor of about 10(10) would be required in SERS in order to achieve single-molecule detection of R6G.},

  abstract = {We present time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations for a tetrahedral Au-20 complex interacting with pyridine for the purpose of modeling absorption and surface enhanced Raman scattering, with emphasis on chemical and electrodynamic enhancement effects. These calculations are done using the ADF code with the BP86 functional, the zeroth-order regular approximation and with the resonant electronic response modeled using a short time approximation expression for the perturbed density matrix, with a damping factor that is empirically chosen. The absorption spectrum of bare Au-20 shows strong intraband (sp-sp) and interband (sp-d) coupling with a low-energy peak at 2.89 eV that is mostly intraband and other peaks at 3.94 and 4.70 eV that have mixed intra- and interband character. SERS spectra are calculated for pyridine/Au-20 for both vertex (V) and surface (S) configurations at their respective lowest energy absorption maxima (near 2.89 eV), and we find that the V configuration has higher intensities that correspond to SERS enhancements of 10(3)-10(4), whereas S has an enhancement of 10(2)-10(3). These enhancement values are significantly lower than the analogous results for pyridine/Ag-20 primarily because of reduced oscillator strength associated with the intraband transition in Au-20. Decomposition of the pyridine/ Au-20 enhancement factor into chemical and electromagnetic contributions (through an analysis of the static SERS intensities) shows enhanced chemical enhancements compared to Ag-20 but reduced electromagnetic enhancements.},

To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVTMD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O2 systems. From simulations on methane/O2, o-xylene/O2, propene/O2, and benzene/O2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene > o-xylene > methane > benzene), following the trend in the CH bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.},

The RR spectra have been simulated from the vibronic theory of RR scattering as well as within the short-time approximation, while the solvent effects have been modeled using the polarizable continuum model. The S1 and S3 states of R6G present UVvis absorption bands with similar vibronic structure, i.e., a shoulder at smaller wavelengths, although this shoulder is relatively more intense and more sensitive to the solvent in the case of S3. These differences are corroborated by the larger geometry relaxations upon excitation for S3 and the fact that the charge transfer of S3 is reduced in ethanol. Moreover, the differences between S1 and S3 are magnified when considering the RR spectra. On one hand, the RR spectrum of R6G in resonance with the S0 S1 transition presents many transitions of which the relative intensities strongly vary when the excitation wavelength gets closer to the maximum of absorption. The RR spectrum of R6G in resonance with S1 is however little influenced by the solvent. On the other hand, the RR spectrum of R6G in resonance with the S0 S3 transition displays only a few bands, strongly depends on the solvent, and is little affected when changing the excitation wavelength within the limits of the absorption band. As a consequence, the short-time approximation is suitable to reproduce the RR spectrum of R6G in resonance with S3 for a broad range of excitation wavelengths, whereas the vibronic theory approach is needed for describing the RR spectrum of R6G in resonance with S1 close to resonance.},

While the resonance Raman spectra show only g symmetry modes, almost all of the hyper-Raman frequencies can be assigned as fundamentals of Eu symmetry that also are observed in the infrared absorption spectrum or Eu symmetry combination bands. These results contrast sharply with previous observations of highly noncentrosymmetric push−pull conjugated molecules and are consistent with a structure for phthalocyanine in solution that is centrosymmetric or nearly so. The hyper-Raman spectra show different intensity patterns in the two excitation regions, consistent with different Franck−Condon and/or vibronic coupling matrix elements for the different resonant states.},

  abstract = {Currently available density functionals cannot describe the dispersion component of the interaction energy present in weakly bound complexes. Moreover, the exchange energy as obtained from the density-functional theory is often incorrect. Examples of problematic cases include clusters of van der Waals-bound rare-gas atoms and most hydrogen-bonded molecular systems. Thus, accurate ab initio methods to treat intermolecular forces should be used in such systems. These methods are, however, too slow to be applicable to the large systems needed to model adsorption. This is why DFT continues to be used, where, in addition, a quite common compensation of errors sometimes produces some sort of agreement with the corresponding experimental data. In this paper, we analyze in detail the inadequacy of standard DFT for describing the weak binding present in a few rare gas-rare gas, metal atom-rare gas, and metal atom-metal atom dimers. Inspired by the success of the Hartree-Fock plus (damped) dispersion (HFD) method, we test the use of an improved hybrid model in which to a density-functional interaction energy (with corrected exchange and avoidance of double-counting of dispersion), a (damped) dispersion expansion is added in the usual way. Comparisons with accurate theoretical or experimental benchmarks show that our DFdD method using the revPBEx or revPBEx+VWNc functionals and accurate dispersion coefficients is found to recover the interaction energy curves very well for many of the tested systems. The second paper in this series will describe the use of the DFdD method for physisorption for the previously well-studied (but not solved) case of Xe/Cu(111).},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is a technique preferably used for studies of water structure because the proportions of intensities of main OH stretching modes are thought to reflect well a network of "intermonomer" hydrogen bonds as well as its disturbance by the presence of some solutes. The work presented herein demonstrates how the intensity ratio of two main components (around 3200 and 3400 cm-1) depends on the excitation wavelength in the visible range. Polarized Raman spectra indicate that the component at ca. 3200 cm-1 is in resonance with light from the red range, which is in agreement with the presence of vibrational overtones in UV-vis absorption spectrum of water. These results are the first report on the occurrence of the Raman resonance effect in liquid water.},

  abstract = {A coupled polarization-matrix inversion and iteration (CPII) method is described to achieve and accelerate the convergence of induced dipoles for condensed phase systems employing polarizable intermolecular potential functions (PIPF). The present PIPF is based on the Thole interaction dipole model in which all atomic pair interactions are considered, including those that are directly bonded covalently. Although induced dipoles can be obtained both by inverting a 3N ? 3N polarization-matrix where N is the number of polarizable sites, or by a direct iterative approach, the latter approach is more efficient computationally for large systems in molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that induced dipole moments failed to converge in the direct iterative approach if 1?2, 1?3, and 1?4 intramolecular interactions are included in the Thole model. However, it is necessary to include all intramolecular interactions in the Thole model to yield the correct molecular anisotropic polarizability tensor. To solve this numerical stability problem, we reformulated the Thole interaction dipole model in terms of molecular block matrices, which naturally leads to a coupled, preconditioning algorithm that involves a polarization-matrix inversion term to account for intramolecular interactions, and an iterative procedure to incorporate the mutual polarization effects between different molecules. The CPII method is illustrated by applying to cubic boxes of water and NMA molecules as well as an alanine pentapeptide configuration, and it was shown that the CPII method can achieve convergence for the dipole induction polarization rapidly in all cases, whereas the direct iterative approach failed to reach convergence in these cases.

The focus of the paper is on a specific approach to include solvent effects, namely the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Such a method represents an efficient strategy if coupled to proper quantum-mechanical descriptions such as the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). As a result, the description of molecules in the condensed phase can be extended to excited states still maintaining the computational efficiency and the physical reliability of the ground-state calculations. The most important theoretical and computational aspects of the coupling between PCM and TDDFT are presented and discussed together with an example of application to the study of the low-lying electronic excited states of push-pull chromophores in different solvents.},

We also found major discrepancies between the measured SERS intensities and those predicted from the electromagnetic mechanism. Through analysis of SERS bands, we concluded that sharp features on the Ag nanocubes could greatly increase the contribution of the chemical enhancement to the SERS intensity.},

A consistent treatment of both the chemical and electromagnetic enhancements is achieved by employing a recently developed approach based on a short-time approximation for the Raman and ROA cross-sections. As an initial application we study a model system consisting of adenine interacting with a Ag20 cluster. Because both the silver cluster and adenine in the absorption geometry are achiral, the chiroptical properties are due to the interactions between the two systems. Our results show that the total enhancement is on the order of 104 both for SEROA and SERS. However, the chemical enhancement is found to be larger for SEROA than for SERS. The results presented here show that SEROA can be a useful approach for studying induced chirality in small metal clusters due to the absorption of molecules.},

Initial solvation shell geometries were generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Clusters consisting of solute and 5 solvent molecules were fully relaxed in quantum mechanical calculations. The free energy of solvation of the solute was calculated from the free energy of formation of the cluster, and the solvation free energy of the cluster was calculated with continuum solvation models. The method has been implemented with two continuum solvation models, a Poisson-Boltzmann model and the IEF-PCM model. Calculations were carried out for a set of 60 ionic species. Implemented with the Poisson-Boltzmann model the method gave an unsigned average error of 2.1 kcal/mol and a rmsd of 2.6 kcal/mol for anions; for cations the unsigned average error was 2.8 kcal/mol and the rmsd 3.9 kcal/mol. Similar results were obtained with the IEF-PCM model. },

  abstract = {The detection of analyte-binding events by receptors is drawing together the fields of Raman spectroscopy and supramolecular chemistry. This study is intended to facilitate this cohering by examining a model system in the solution phase. The resonance Raman scattering (RRS) spectra of the complexation between tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT4+) has been used as the model to characterize the binding event of a host-guest system. RRS spectra are generated by excitation (\^I\guillemotrightexc = 785 nm) within the lowest-energy charge-transfer (CT) transition (Emax = 865 nm) of the TTF-CBPQT4+ complex. The paired binding curves from the RRS and UV-vis-NIR titration data agrees with prior work, and a dG of 5.7 \^A\textpm 0.6 kcal mol-1 (MeCN, 298 K) was obtained for the complexation of TTF with CBPQT4+. Computations on the complex and its components reproduce the energy shifts and resonance enhancements of the Raman band intensities, providing a basis to identify the structural and vibrational changes occurring upon complexation. The changes in bond lengths coincide with partial depopulation of a TTF-based HOMO and population of a CBPQT4+-based LUMO through CT mixing in the ground state of 0.46e-. The structural changes upon complexation generally lead to lower wavenumber vibrations and to changes in the normal mode descriptions.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a study of the excitation energies of adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and the adenine-thymine (AT) and guanine-cytosine (GC) base pairs using long-range corrected (LC) density functional theory. We compare three recent LC functionals, BNL, CAM-B3LYP, and LC-PBE0, with B3LYP and coupled cluster results from the literature. We find that the best overall performance is for the BNL functional based on LDA. However, in order to achieve this good agreement, a smaller attenuation parameter is needed, which leads to nonoptimum performance for ground-state properties. B3LYP, on the other hand, severely underestimates the charge-transfer (CT) transitions in the base pairs. Surprisingly, we also find that the CAM-B3LYP functional also underestimates the CT excitation energy for the GC base pair but correctly describes the AT base pair. This illustrates the importance of retaining the full long-range exact exchange even at distances as short as that of the DNA base pairs. The worst overall performance is obtained with the LC-PBE0 functional, which overestimates the excitations for the individual bases as well as the base pairs. It is therefore crucial to strike a good balance between the amount of local and long-range exact exchange. Thus, this work highlights the difficulties in obtained LC functionals, which provides a good description of both ground- and excited-state properties.},

It is straightforward in this framework to calculate the incident frequency dependence of SEROA intensities, i.e., SEROA excitation profiles. The differential Raman scattering is examined in detail for a simple chiroptical model that provides analytical forms for the relevant dynamical molecular response tensors.

  abstract = {We show that ultrasmall metallic nanoparticles can be combined with large second- and third-order response organic chromophores to enhance the overall third-order response of the system. This approach can be used in combination with microscopic cascading to generate exceptionally large third-order response. Intermolecular charge-transfer coupling between the molecules and the metal clusters enhances the real part of the nonlinearity at telecommunication wavelengths, while avoiding plasmonic enhancement of one- and two-photon absorption, and minimizing optical losses. The results of density functional calculations for a molecule with large second-order response, (para)nitroaniline, show that use of a gold cluster as a link between molecular entities enhances third-order nonlinearity. Varying size and shape of the metal cluster as well as the distance between the clusters and the molecules allows fine-tuning of nonlinear response over a large range of magnitudes.},

A short time approximation for the perturbed density matrix and an empirical damping factor are employed to calculate surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) intensities that account for both chemical and electromagnetic enhancement effects. Chemical effects provide 1--2 orders of magnitude enhancement, whereas electromagnetic effects yield up to 6 orders of magnitude enhancement for CN- or 5 for HCN.

  abstract = {Solvatochromic shifts of the electronic states of a chromophore can be used as a measure of solute-solvent interactions. The shifts of the electronic states of a model organic chromophore, p-nitroaniline (pNA), embedded in solvents with different polarities (water, 1,4-dioxane, and cyclohexane) are studied using a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular-mechanics-type technique in which the chromophore is described by the configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (CIS(D)) method while the solvent is treated by the effective fragment potential (EFP) method. This newly developed CIS(D)/EFP scheme includes the quantum-mechanical coupling of the Coulomb and polarization terms; however, short-range dispersion and exchange-repulsion terms of EFP are not included in the quantum Hamiltonian. The CIS(D)/EFP model is benchmarked against the more accurate equation of motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD)/EFP method on a set of small pNA-water clusters. CIS(D)/EFP accurately predicts the red solvatochromic shift of the charge-transfer \pi--\pi* state of pNA in polar water. The shift is underestimated in less polar dioxane and cyclohexane probably because of the omission of the explicit quantum-mechanical treatment of the short-range terms. Different solvation of singlet and triplet states of pNA results in different probabilities of intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) pathways of energy relaxation in solvents of different polarity. Computed singlet-triplet splittings in water and dioxane qualitatively explain the active ISC channel in dioxane and predict almost no conversion to the triplet manifold in water, in agreement with experimental findings.},

  abstract = {A multiscale method is presented that allows for evaluation of plasmon-enhanced optical properties of nanoparticle/molecule complexes with no additional cost compared to standard electrodynamics (ED) and linear response quantum mechanics (QM) calculations for the particle and molecule, respectively, but with polarization and orientation effects automatically described. The approach first calculates the total field of the nanoparticle by ED using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The field intensity in the frequency domain as a function of distance from the nanoparticle is calculated via a Fourier transform. The molecular optical properties are then calculated with QM in the frequency domain in the presence of the total field of the nanoparticle. Back-coupling due to dipolar reradiation effects is included in the single-molecule plane wave approximation. The effects of polarization and partial orientation averaging are considered. The QM/ED method is evaluated for the well-characterized test case of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of pyridine bound to silver, as well as for the resonant Raman chromophore rhodamine 6G. The electromagnetic contribution to the enhancement factor is 104 for pyridine and 102 for rhodamine 6G.},

  abstract = {The optical absorption spectra of a series of nanocrystal gold moleculeslarger, crystalline Au clusters that are passivated by a compact monolayer of n-alkylthiol(ate)shave been measured across the electronic range (1.1−4.0 eV) in dilute solution at ordinary temperature. Each of the 20 samples, ranging in effective core diameter from 1.4 to 3.2 nm (70 to 800 Au atoms), has been purified by fractional crystallization and has undergone a separate compositional and structural characterization by mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. With decreasing core mass (crystallite size) the spectra uniformly show a systematic evolution, specifically (i) a broadening of the so-called surface-plasmon band until it is essentially unidentifiable for crystallites of less than 2.0 nm effective diameter, (ii) the emergence of a distinct onset for strong absorption near the energy (1.7 eV) of the interbandgap (5d \textrightarrow 6sp), and (iii) the appearance in the smallest crystallites of a weak steplike structure above this onset, which is interpreted as arising from a series of transitions from the continuum d-band to the discrete level structure of the conduction band just above the Fermi level. The classical electrodynamic (Mie) theory, based on bulk optical properties, can reproduce this spectral evolutionand thereby yield a consistent core-sizingonly by making a strong assumption about the surface chemical interaction. Quantitative agreement with the spectral line shape requires a size-dependent offset of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, which may be explained by a transition in electronic structure just below 2.0 nm (200 atoms), as proposed earlier.},

Three solution-phase gold samples with average particle size of 1.9, 2.6, and 3.2 nm with size distribution less than 10% were used. The photoexcitation in the intraband (surface plasmon region) leads to the heating of the conduction electron gas and its subsequent thermalization through electron−electron and electron−phonon interaction. The results are analyzed in terms of the contribution of the equilibrated ``hot'' electrons to the surface plasmon resonance of gold. A different spectral response was observed for different sizes of gold nanoparticles. The results were compared to the dynamics of the large (30 nm diameter) gold nanocrystals colloidal solution. The size-dependent spectral changes are attributed to the reduction of the density of states for small nanoparticles. The observed variation in the kinetics of the cooling process in gold nanoparticles with changing the laser intensity is attributed to the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of the electron gas.},

The time-resolved resonance Raman (TR3) spectrum of Ru(phen)2(dppz)2+ (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) collected under 355 nm (fwhm ≈ 10 ns) excitation is consistent with the population of a ligand-centered (LC) 3$\pi$$\pi$* state of the dppz ligand. Since emission from the Ru(II) \textrightarrow (dppz) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state is observed, both states must possess similar energies. Lowering of the MLCT state energy in Ru(phen)2(F2-dppz)2+ and Os(phen)2(dppz)2+ with respect to that of the 3$\pi$$\pi$* state results in the disappearance of the LC 3$\pi$$\pi$* excited-state peaks in the rR spectrum, indicative of its fast deactivation to the lower MLCT state in these complexes. Addition of DNA to the samples containing Ru(phen)2(dppz)2+ and Ru(phen)2(F2-dppz)2+ leads to a decrease in intensity of the peaks associated with the intercalating phenazine part of the dppz ligand. Further increase in the DNA:Ru ratio causes broadening of the spectrum. This broadening has been interpreted in terms of strong $\pi$$\pi$ interaction between the intercalated dppz ligand and the DNA bases.},

These new molecules are distinguished by a crystalline (or quasicrystalline) core of densely packed Au atoms, ranging in size from 1.1 nm (40 atoms) to 1.9 nm (200 atoms), surrounded by a compact monolayer of various thio (RS) adsorbates. They are obtained as the thermally and environmentally stable products of the reductive decomposition of nonmetallic (−AuS(R)−) polymer in solution, are separated according to size by fractional crystallization or column chromatography, as monitored by high-mass spectrometry, and are characterized structurally by methods including X-ray diffraction (small and large angle), high-resolution electron microscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. The optical absorption spectra of dilute solutions of these molecules show size-dependent steplike structure with an onset near the fcc Au interband edge ($\Delta$ = 1.7), indicative of transitions to the discrete lowest unoccupied levels of the conduction band. This structure is evident in the smallest clusters even at room temperature, is enhanced at low temperature, and emerges generally as predicted by Kubo's criterion for quantum size effects. It thus requires no assumption of a transition from the bulk metallic bonding character to a nonmetallic (rehybridized or oxidized) state.},

  abstract = {A photoelectrochemical cell utilizing flavonoid anthocyanin dyes extracted from blackberries, along with colloidal TiO2 powder, is shown to convert sunlight to electrical power at an efficiency of 0.56% under full sun. Fluorescence quenching is observed for the excited state of the TiO2-adsorbed anthocyanin dye, cyanin, and the photocurrent spectrum correlates well with the optical absorption of the cyanin-sensitized TiO2 nanocrystalline film. The incident photon-to-current efficiency of 19% at the peak of the visible absorption band of the dye, the open-circuit voltages of 0.5-0.4 V, and short-circuit photocurrents of 1.5-2.2 mA/cm2 are remarkable for such a simple system and suggest efficient charge carrier injection. The ultrafast excited-state dynamics of cyanin in solution are compared with those of surface-adsorbed cyanin on TiO2 and ZrO2 colloids, as well as complexed with Al(III) ions. A transient absorption signal with a risetime of <100 fs for cyanin-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles is assigned to electrons injected from the dye to TiO2. This signal is fit to a double-exponential decay with time constants of 0.52 and 67 ps. The 0.52 ps component is due to trapping of conduction band electrons or to fast direct recombination with the dye cation, while the 67 ps decay is attributed to trap state mediated indirect recombination. In contrast, stimulated emission with a 2.6 ps decay time is observed for cyanin in solution, cyanin on ZrO2, and cyanin complexed with Al(III) ions. When compared to the photon-to-current efficiency measured for the solar cell, the efficiency estimated from the injection and recombination rate constants suggests that electron recapture by the redox mediator and light screening mechanisms may limit the efficiency of the cell.},

Computation of scattering intensities for all three classes of Raman-active modes (polarized, depolarized, and inversely polarized) observed in metalloporphyrin spectra was made possible in this fashion. Vibronic parameters were evaluated at the INDO level from the dependence of electronic transition moments and transition energies upon nuclear coordinates; the transform theory of RR scattering was then applied to compute the relative intensities of vibrational modes. The calculated enhancement patterns are in excellent agreement with experimental results. Three vibrational modes of b1g symmetry (nu10, nu11, and nu16) are identified as being the primary Jahn-Teller distortion coordinates: a substantial fraction of the total internal-mode reorganization energy for S0 - S1 photoexcitation is predicted to arise from symmetry-lowering. Interference between Condon and non-Condon scattering amplitudes is found to be a major determinant of the intensities of several polarized vibrations as well as those depolarized modes which are Jahn-Teller active. The dependence of scattering intensity on excitation wavelength for such modes is correctly predicted, indicating that the relative amplitudes and phasing of Condon and non-Condon contributions for each vibration are reliably determined.},

The Au:SG clusters appear to share the high stability and robustness of their hydrophobic n-alkyl analogues but are highly water soluble. The most abundant cluster produced by these methods can be easily separated from its homologues by gel electrophoresis. Its total molecular weight is ca. 10.4 kDa, and the mass of its strongly bound inorganic core is 5.6 kDa, suggesting the composition Au28(SG)16. This composition is also consistent with the X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystalline molecular solid. Distinct features in the optical absorption spectroscopy are inherently different from either larger clusters or smaller gold cluster compounds. The compound is optically active, as evidenced by circular dichroism in the near-IR, visible, and near-UV regions. The 13C NMR spectra suggest that the bonding environment of the GSadsorbate is similar to that of the n-alkyladsorbate clusters, and the nonsulfhydryl properties are retained. The cluster is thus envisioned as a large metallic-cluster compound with distinctive optical properties encapsulated by a bioactive peptide monolayer.},

Phys. Chem. B 1998, 102, 106436]. Identification of the separated compounds by core mass is accomplished through laser desorption mass spectrometry of matrix-diluted films. Three principal compounds have core masses of ca. 4.3, 5.6, and 8.2 kDa (in the range of 2040 Au atoms), and show structured optical absorption spectra with clear optical absorption onsets near 1.7, 1.3, and 1.0 eV, respectively. Each of these shows unusually strong chiroptical activity in the metal-based electronic transitions across the near-infrared, visible, and near-ultraviolet regions, whereas neither the crude (unseparated) mixture nor its higher molecular weight components possess such strong optical activity. The location and strength of the optical activity suggest a metal electronic structure that is highly sensitive to the chiral environment imposed by the glutathione adsorbate groups, if indeed the gold core is not inherently chiral. Mechanisms that could account for the observed optical activity are discussed, but the mere presence of strong chiroptical effects in this metallic-cluster system places these novel compounds in a special class of molecular substances. Previously known giant metal-cluster compounds (and nanocrystals) have not been reported to exhibit significant optical activity. With these results, there emerges a rather complete picture of the evolution of optical and electronic properties of thiol-based gold cluster compounds (or self-assembled monolayer passivated gold nanocrystals) from 20 to 1000 Au atoms (0.73.2 nm core diameter).},

  abstract = {A resonance Raman intensity analysis is presented for the carbazole/tetracyanoethylene donor−acceptor charge-transfer complex in dichloromethane solution. The intent is to determine the nuclear reorganization contributions to the rates of charge hopping in carbazole polymers used as hole-transport agents in the xerographic (electrophotographic) process. Resonance Raman cross sections have been measured at seven excitation wavelengths spanning the broad visible charge-transfer absorption known to consist of two strongly overlapping charge-transfer electronic transitions. Interference between the Raman amplitudes from these two transitions manifests itself in the Raman excitation profiles for a number of resonantly enhanced modes. Simultaneous modeling of the absorption spectrum and the Raman cross sections shows that explicit consideration of the signs as well as the magnitudes of the normal mode displacements is required to reproduce the experimental data. The signs of the mode displacements obtained from the modeling are shown to be consistent with qualitative predictions based on the nodal patterns of the donor molecular orbitals and the forms of the resonantly enhanced normal modes. Mode-specific reorganization energies for the carbazole donor and tetracyanoethylene acceptor are obtained from the analysis along with parameters describing the magnitude and time scale of the solvent contributions to the reorganization energy. Approximately 60% of the total reorganization energy of 5100 cm-1 in each charge-transfer state is attributed to solvent and any other classically behaved low-frequency modes, with the remainder about equally divided between donor and acceptor modes. The partitioning of the reorganization energy among the carbazole modes is significantly different for the two electronic transitions.},

Comparison of 514.5 and 632.8 nm excitation shows that the single molecule R6G signal is significantly higher when the excitation wavelength is resonant with the absorption band of R6G and suggests that the Raman excitation spectrum follows the absorption profile for R6G. We have also observed an interesting superlinear power dependence of the SERS signal. On average, by increasing the incident power by 2 orders of magnitude and decreasing the integration time by the same factor to maintain constant fluence, increases of 4 to 6 times were observed in the SERS intensity. We discuss these results in terms of model where the R6G molecule that yields single molecule SERS signals is located at the junction of two Ag nanoparticles. We have also modeled the system using molecular resonance Raman theory to provide further insight into the enhancement mechanism.},

Raman lines from the solar cell were assigned to vibrations from the different constituents. In a cell with only lithium iodide added to the solvent, the formation of triiodide was observed at 114 and 226 cm-1. The amount of thiocyanato group coordinated to the dye, estimated from the CN stretching observed at 2105 cm-1, decreased with the increased amount of iodine added or triiodide formed in the electrolyte. It was shown that the thiocyanato ligands formed a complex with iodine, I2SCN-, indicated by a weak Raman line at 165 cm-1. From UV−vis measurement, the dye after the SCN- loss is proposed to be a cis-bis(iodo)bis(2,2`-bipyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 4`-carboxylate)ruthenium(II) complex. It is suggested that the electrolyte additive 4-tert-butylpyridine suppresses the loss of the thiocyanato group from the dye.},

  abstract = {Large spectral fluctuations, on a time scale of many seconds, are demonstrated in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering of single rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on silver nanocrystals and excited at 532 nm. These fluctuations are especially evident in the case of the vibrational bands at 614 and 774 cm-1. A definite connection between spectral fluctuations and changes in the shape of the diffuse background emitted with the SERS spectrum is seen, pointing to the possible origin of both in a molecule-surface charge transfer phenomenon. The rate of spectral fluctuations is shown to depend linearly on laser intensity through a nonthermal mechanism. The rate of fluctuations can also be modified by changing the anion concentration in the solution on top of the silver colloids. Analysis of the results suggests that the fluctuations are due to motion of the adsorbed molecule on the surface, triggered by photodesorption events that are mediated by electron tunneling between the molecule and surface. Our results show that single-molecule Raman scattering can serve as a sensitive local probe for the dynamics of adsorbed molecules under ambient conditions.},

All normal Raman and SERS bands were assigned to normal modes on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations (B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p)) and isotope shifts. Surface selection rules derived from the electromagnetic enhancement model were employed to deduce adenine orientations on the different surfaces. On the colloids, adenine adopts an almost perpendicular orientation interacting with the metal surface via N7 and the exocyclic amino group. On the electrodes, adenine adsorbs in a more tilted orientation while on the island films the tilt is even more pronounced. Interaction with the electrodes takes place through N7 and the amino group, while interaction with the island film may be solely through N7.},

  abstract = {Recent research in several groups has identified a new class of metal colloidal nanoparticles that is able to enhance the efficiencies of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by as much as 10141015 fold. This enormous enhancement allows single-molecule detection and spectroscopy at room temperature. Previous single-molecule and single-particle studies have yielded important insights into the mechanism of electromagnetic field enhancement, but little is known about the contributions of surface active sites and chemical enhancement. Here we report a direct examination of chemical enhancement by using an integrated flow injection and ultrasensitive optical imaging/spectroscopy system. A key feature is that colloidal silver nanoparticles are immobilized on a glass surface inside a microflow device and that single-particle SERS signals are observed in real time while the immobilized particles are treated by chemical reagents in the flow cell. In situ surface plasmon scattering studies of spatially isolated particles indicate that their electromagnetic properties do not change after chemical treatment. Thus, the observed SERS spectral changes should primarily come from chemical enhancement at surface active sites. Our experimental data reveal that three halide ions (Cl-, Br-, and I-) have a substantial activating effect, whereas other ions such as citrate, sulfate, and fluoride have little or no effect on single-particle SERS. A quenching effect is observed for thiosulfate ions, which completely destroys the SERS activity. The chemical enhancement factors are estimated to be about 102103 for rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on single Ag nanoparticles},

  abstract = {The stability and reproducibility of most SERS-active electrode surfaces are far from ideal. We have focused on this problem by developing and characterizing a metal film over nanosphere (MFON) electrode which solves these shortcomings. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of representative molecules were used to characterize and evaluate the electrochemical and SERS performance of MFON electrodes. Tremendous stability to extremely negative potential excursions is observed for MFON electrodes as compared to standard metal oxidation reduction cycle (MORC) roughened electrodes. Consequently, irreversible loss of SERS intensity at negative potentials is not observed on these MFON electrodes. We conclude that MFON electrodes present a significant advantage over MORC electrodes because SERS enhancement is not lost upon excursion to extremely negative potentials. This work demonstrates that the MFON substrate, while easily prepared and temporally stable, offers unprecedented stability and reproducibility for electrochemical SERS experiments. Furthermore, one can conclude that irreversible loss is not a distinguishing characteristic of electrochemical SERS and consequently cannot be used as evidence to support the chemical enhancement mechanism.},

Measurements on cluster films coated with chromophoric polymer or with thiol-bound chromophores give spatially-averaged enhancements of 1000 and 20000, respectively. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy studies show that the enhancements are spatially inhomogeneous, with peak-enhancement factors of $\sim$10000 (polymer/cluster) and $\sim$160000 (thiol chromophore/cluster), and excitation frequency dependent. These results are in accord with theoretical predictions of local-field effects due to strong localization of collective plasmon modes in fractal metal clusters, and demonstrate an approach to ultrasensitive two-photon processes.},

  abstract = {In the mid-1970s, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was discovered which impacted on surface science and spectroscopy because of its extremely high surface sensitivity. However, SERS had not developed as many people had hoped to be a powerful surface diagnostic technique that can be widely used because of some obstacles. For example, only three noble metals Au, Ag, and Cu could provide large enhancement, severely limiting the widespread applications involving other metallic materials of both fundamental and practical importance. In this article, emphasis is put on the recent work of our group to directly generate SERS on net transition metals (e.g., Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys) by developing various roughening procedures and optimizing the performance of the confocal Raman microscope. An approach of replacing the randomly roughened surface with ordered nanorod arrays of transition metals is introduced as a promising class of highly SERS-active substrates. The surface enhancement factor for transition metals was calculated, which ranged from 1 to 4 orders of magnitude. The applications of SERS in surface adsorption, electro-catalysis, and corrosion of transition-metal-based systems demonstrated several advantages of in situ surface Raman spectroscopy. A preliminary theoretical approach, considering the electromagnetic and chemical contributions, is presented to explain the SERS behavior of transition metal electrodes and nanorod arrays. It has been shown that SERS together with other surface-enhanced optical phenomena could be one of important issues not only in surface science but also in nanoscale science. Prospects and further developments in this exciting field are discussed with emphasis on the emerging experimental methodology.},

A molecular model with a Ag atom attached to the pyridine nitrogen was used in the Urey-Bradley calculation. The frequency shifts in the SERS spectrum were calculated by adding K(Ag-N) and F(Ag? ? ?C) force constants and by adjusting the ring stretches according to how their bond lengths changed in an ab initio calculation with a (Ag-Py)+ model. The ab initio calculations were done with the HF, MP2, and B3LYP methods using the 3-21G, 6-31G, 6-31G*, 6-31G**, and LanL2DZ basis sets. The surface active site was modeled in the calculation by means of Ag0, Ag+ atoms, and a Ag4+ pyramidal cluster structure. The calculations were evaluated on how well they matched the observed frequencies, the (Ag-N) stretch, and the frequency shifts for the SERS spectrum in an electrochemical environment. The calculation with the Ag4+ model yielded the best results although the (Ag-Py)+ model also gives reasonable results. All calculations were consistent with an edge-on interaction between pyridine and the electrode surface and a Ag+ species as part of the surface active site.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the electromagnetic interactions between noble metal nanoparticles are studied by measuring the extinction spectra of two-dimensional arrays of Au and Ag cylinders and trigonal prisms that have been fabricated with electron beam lithography. The nanoparticles are typically 200 nm in diameter and 35 nm in height; both hexagonal and square array patterns have been considered with lattice spacings that vary from 230 to 500 nm. The extinction spectra typically have a maximum in the 700-800 nm region of the spectrum, and this maximum blue shifts as lattice spacing is reduced, having typically a 40 nm decrease in $\lambda$max for a 100 nm decrease in lattice spacing. The results are similar for the different noble metals, array patterns, and nanoparticle shapes. The extinction spectra have been modeled using coupled dipole calculations, and the observed spectral variations are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the computational analysis indicates that the blue shifts are due to radiative dipolar coupling between the nanoparticles and retardation effects. These effects result in a net depolarization of the dipole couplings for lattice spacings of 200-500 nm.},

  abstract = {We use high-quality electrodynamics methods to study the extinction spectra of one-dimensional linear chains and two-dimensional planar arrays of spherical silver nanoparticles, placing emphasis on the variation of the plasmon resonance wavelength and width with array structure (spacing, symmetry), particle size, and polarization direction. Two levels of theory have been considered, coupled dipoles with fully retarded interactions and T-matrix theory that includes a converged multipole expansion on each particle. We find that the most important array effects for particles having a radius of 30 nm or smaller are captured by the couple dipole approach. Our calculations demonstrate several surprising effects that run counter to conventional wisdom in which the particle interactions are assumed to be governed by electrostatic dipolar interactions. In particular, we find that for planar arrays of particles with polarization parallel to the plane the plasmon resonance blue shifts as array spacing D decreases for D larger than about 75 nm and then it red shifts for smaller spacings. In addition, we find that the plasmon narrows for D > 180 nm but broadens for smaller spacings. The results can be rationalized using a simple analytical model, which demonstrates that the plasmon wavelength shift is determined by the real part of the retarded dipole sum while the width is determined by the imaginary part of this sum. The optimal blue shifts and narrowing are found when the particle spacing is slightly smaller than the plasmon wavelength, while red shifts and broadening can be found for spacings much smaller than the plasmon wavelength at which electrostatic interactions are dominant. We also find that the array spectrum does not change significantly with array symmetry (square or hexagonal) or irradiated spot size (i.e., constant array size or constant particle number).},

Density functional theory calculations have been carried out, both within the standard and the time-dependent formalisms, to assign the most relevant electronic and infrared features of these chromophores and to assess useful information about their molecular structures. Both theoretical calculations and vibrational spectra demonstrate the occurrence of a sizable intramolecular charge transfer from the electron-donor unit to the electron-acceptor group in the ground state. The optical properties of the chromophores are strongly influenced by the electron spacer. The intense optical absorptions recorded in the visible mainly correspond to the $\pi$−$\pi$* excitation of the oligothienoquinonoid bridge. As an additional merit of these molecular materials, their infrared spectra recorded at various temperatures between −170 and +180 \textdegreeC reveal, at the molecular level, their high thermal stability, what has importance for their potential use in molecular electronics and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {A general model concerning the role of the electrode potential on the charge-transfer enhancement mechanism of SERS is proposed, justifying the existence of a parameter $\beta$ which reduces the effectiveness of the electrode potential in order to shift the excited charge-transfer level. This explains the observed deviation of $\beta$ from the unity, and allows for relating the intensity/electrode-potential (SERS-CT) profiles of similar adsorbates with the respective electron affinities. The SERS of pyridine, pyrazine and methylpyrazines have been recorded on silver, being found that the electrode potential in the maximum of the SERS-CT profiles shifts toward more negative values as the number of methylsubstituents attached to the pyrazine ring increases. This result has been explained on the basis of the relative stability of the radical anions given that a correlation between those shifts and the calculated ab initio vertical transition energies between the neutral molecules and their respective radical anions can be established. This confirms the participation of a resonant charge-transfer mechanism in the SERS as well as the usefulness of this technique to gain insight into the electronic properties of the doublet states of the here studied molecules.},

  abstract = {Temporal fluctuations in the Raman spectrum from molecules adsorbed to noble metal colloids (i.e., blinking) has been viewed as a single molecule signature. It is demonstrated here that silver colloids exhibit blinking that is independent of the nature of the adsorbate. Blinking was observed on silver colloids in the presence and absence of a SERS probe (e.g., R6G, BPE), sodium chloride, poly-l-lysine, an alkanethiol layer, and a liquid overlayer (e.g., water, methanol). These observations suggest that the mechanism that gives rise to blinking is insensitive to the nature of the adsorbate and is likely to be a property of the nanoparticle. Consistent with this idea, blinking was observed from vapor-deposited silver films and silver powders with no added molecular probe. In addition, two distinct broad luminescence-like (continuum) features also exhibited blinking and spectral diffusion, with no apparent adsorbate dependence. Evidence that SERS and the underlying continuum are associated is provided by an observed correlation of on and off states for both processes.},

  abstract = {The experimental observables in coherent, multiple pulse infrared spectroscopic measurements can be calculated from the nonlinear response functions describing the nuclear dynamics of molecular and condensed phase systems. Within classical mechanics, these nonlinear response functions can be expressed in terms of the monodromy matrices that quantify the stability of classical trajectories. We use an ensemble of noninteracting, anharmonic oscillators to examine the effects of the divergence in time of the classical stability matrix on the analytic properties of the third-order response function, relevant to vibrational echo spectroscopy. The two-pulse echo measurement is designed to rephase a macroscopic variable, that is, to reverse the effects of destructive interference among the dynamics of microscopic systems characterized by a static distribution of energies. Within classical mechanics, this rephasing is shown to preserve the growth with time of the nonlinear response function that is the signature of the divergence of nearby trajectories. For systems with nearly classical nuclear motions, the vibrational echo measurement may then be interpreted as a probe of the stability of atomic trajectories.},

The enhancement is not due to the presence of metallic silver on the surface as ruled out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the fibers show 10-fold spectral amplification due to the increased coupling of evanescent waves through an increased number of internal reflections to the samples on the surface of the thin planar element. A special cell for the fiber permits deposition of small quantities of solution followed by slow evaporation of the solvent with dry nitrogen and allows measurements to be made on much less than a monolayer of sample. The combination of easy access to the sample and high sensitivity promises many useful applications to biological, chemical, and physical problems in the mesoscopic and nanoscopic domains.},

  abstract = {The surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of a number of species and strains of bacteria obtained on novel gold nanoparticle (80 nm) covered SiO2 substrates excited at 785 nm is reported. Raman cross-section enhancements of >104 per bacterium are found for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria on these SERS active substrates. The SERS spectra of bacteria are spectrally less congested and exhibit greater species differentiation than their corresponding non-SERS (bulk) Raman spectra at this excitation wavelength. Fluorescence observed in the bulk Raman emission of Bacillus species is not apparent in the corresponding SERS spectra. Despite the field enhancement effects arising from the nanostructured metal surface, this fluorescence component appears quenched due to an energy transfer process which does not diminish the Raman emission. The surface enhancement effect allows the observation of Raman spectra of single bacterial cells excited at low incident powers and short data acquisition times. SERS spectra of B. anthracis Sterne illustrate this single cell level capability. Comparison with previous SERS studies reveals how the SERS vibrational signatures are strongly dependent on the morphology and nature of the SERS active substrates. The potential of SERS for detection and identification of bacterial pathogens with species and strain specificity on these gold particle covered glassy substrates is demonstrated by these results.},

These NSL-derived Ag nanoparticle array surfaces are both structurally well-characterized and extremely uniform in size. The WS SERES spectra are correlated, both spatially and spectrally, with the corresponding localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra of the nanoparticle arrays. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra were measured in two excitation wavelength ranges: (1) 425-505 nm, and (2) 610-800 nm, as well as with the 532-nm line from a solid-state diode-pumped laser. The WS SERES spectra have line shapes similar to those of the LSPR spectra. The maximum SERS enhancement factor is shown to occur for excitation wavelengths that are blue-shifted with respect to the LSPR $\lambda$max of adsorbate-covered nanoparticle arrays. Three vibrational modes of benzenethiol (1575, 1081, and 1009 cm-1) are studied simultaneously on one substrate, and it is demonstrated that the smaller Raman shifted peak shows a maximum enhancement closer to the LSPR $\lambda$max than that of a larger Raman shifted peak. This is in agreement with the predictions of the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement mechanism of SERS. Enhancement factors of up to 108 are achieved, which is also in good agreement with our previous SERES studies.},

  abstract = {This feature article highlights work from the authors' laboratories on the synthesis, assembly, reactivity, and optical applications of metallic nanoparticles of nonspherical shape, especially nanorods. The synthesis is a seed-mediated growth procedure, in which metal salts are reduced initially with a strong reducing agent, in water, to produce 4 nm seed particles. Subsequent reduction of more metal salt with a weak reducing agent, in the presence of structure-directing additives, leads to the controlled formation of nanorods of specified aspect ratio and can also yield other shapes of nanoparticles (stars, tetrapods, blocks, cubes, etc.). Variations in reaction conditions and crystallographic analysis of gold nanorods have led to insight into the growth mechanism of these materials. Assembly of nanorods can be driven by simple evaporation from solution or by rational design with molecular-scale connectors. Short nanorods appear to be more chemically reactive than long nanorods. Finally, optical applications in sensing and imaging, which take advantage of the visible light absorption and scattering properties of the nanorods, are discussed. },

The simultaneous use of two analyte molecules enables a clear confirmation of the single (or few)-molecule nature of the signals. This method eliminates most of the uncertainties associated with low dye concentrations in previous experiments.

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of pyrimidine recorded on a silver electrode have been analyzed on the basis of a resonant Raman (RR) process involving photoexcited charge transfer (CT) states of the metal-adsorbate surface complex. The main feature of the SERS of benzene and azine derivatives is the enhancement of the totally symmetric ring stretching mode 8a due to Franck-Condon contributions related to the CT transition. Although this behavior is observed in the SERS of pyrimidine, its spectrum is also characterized by the strong enhancement of the nontotally symmetric mode 8b. This peculiar feature can be explained only by the redistribution of the Franck-Condon factors between the 8ab pair of vibrations originated by the descent in symmetry occurring when pyrimidine is bonded to silver nanoclusters. This conclusion is a new evidence of the main role of the RR-CT enhancement mechanism in the SERS of aromatic molecules and shows once again the usefulness of the methodology developed by our group in order to analyze these complex spectra},

Phys. 2004, 121, 10190) to treat the effect of a metal particle on the optical properties of a molecule in solution (close to such a particle) in the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). This extension concerns the combination of such a model with the semiempirical method Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO), which allows us to treat large size molecular systems, as the ones normally used in the experiments. A refinement of the model is also introduced to take into account the effect of the metal specimen on the absorption process of the molecular system, which affects the probability that a molecule reaches the excited state. Numerical tests are presented to validate the reliability of the ZINDO results with respect to quantum-mechanical DFT methods. Comparisons with experimental results on two different large molecular systems are reported, and the effect of the metal on the absorption process is discussed. },

The emission behavior under anaerobic conditions was strikingly different from that obtained under an oxygen-containing atmosphere. Specifically, emission intensity increased as a function of time with no photoinduced signal decay. A simple mechanistic model was developed and demonstrated to accurately predict the photodynamic trends observed under both conditions. The model involves oxygen-mediated cyclic production and destruction of photoactive silver clusters on the thin film. The evidence presented here strongly supports the hypothesis that oxygen plays a key role in the blinking phenomenon observed on SERS-active Ag films.},

Long-range correction is shown to eliminate the catastrophic underestimation of charge-transfer (CT) excitation energies that plagues conventional TD-DFT, at the expense of introducing one adjustable parameter, $\mu$, that determines the length scale on which Hartree−Fock exchange is turned on. This parameter allows us to interpolate smoothly between hybrid density functionals and time-dependent Hartree−Fock theory. Excitation energies for CT states (in which an electron is transferred from one adenine molecule to the other) are found to increase dramatically as a function of $\mu$. Uncorrected hybrid functionals underestimate the CT excitation energies, placing them well below the valence excitations, while time-dependent Hartree−Fock calculations place these states well above the valence states. Values for $\mu$ determined from certain benchmark calculations place the CT states well above the valence $\pi$$\pi$* and n$\pi$* states at the Franck−Condon point.},

Structural relaxation of the selected model system in the protein environment has been fully included by the alternative quantum and molecular mechanical optimizations. The polarized continuum model (PCM) was used to simulate interaction between the model system and the protein environment. The CO binding could take place in a concerted way and a barrier of 17.9 kcal mol-1 was predicted on the concerted singlet pathway, which is not favorable in energy. The adiabatically sequential pathway requires an energy of 14.5 kcal mol-1 for formation of the singlet intermediate. There exist two nonadiabatic sequential pathways for the CO binding, which involves the triplet and quintet states of intermediate. Both the singlet/triplet and singlet/quintet intersections play an important role in nonadiabatic sequential processes, which enhance the probability that the processes occur. The nonadiabatic processes that involve the triplet and quintet states of intermediate are the most probable pathways for the CO binding to the hexacoordinated heme in Ngb to form the product complex.},

The trajectory analysis reveals that the first solvation sphere consists of chains of H-bonded water molecules intercalating between the bpy ligands, which in turns induces an organization of the second solvation sphere. Comparison with a simple charged sphere model shows the influence of the geometry of the cation and its ligands on the surrounding water. A water residence time in the first solvation shell of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ of 12.4 ps is computed, which is significantly larger than the value of 4.5 ps found in bulk water. On the other hand, due to the one-dimensional arrangement of hydrogen bonds, the dipole of the water molecules can easily reorient, providing a way to explain the fast solvent dependent relaxation dynamics observed following photoexcitation. },

Experimental investigation of the well characterized dopamine−TiO2 system revealed an unexpected dependence on coverage and size. We propose here a theoretical model applicable to SERS on semiconducting substrates that explains this remarkable behavior. The model is based on a competition mechanism arising from the formation of an electron gas in the conduction band of the semiconductor due to the photoexcitation of a charge-transfer complex. Taking into account the two competing effects, a linear increase in the Raman intensity arising from increasing coverage and a quenching effect due to the photon absorption by the electron gas, provides excellent agreement between our model and the experiment for 5 nm nanoparticles. Discrepancies for the case of 2 nm nanoparticles are attributed to quantum confinement, an effect that is investigated elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Electrodynamic simulations of gold nanoparticle spectra were used to investigate the sensitivity of localized surface plasmon band position to the refractive index, n, of the medium for nanoparticles of various shapes and nanoshells of various structures. Among single-component nanoparticles less than 130 nm in size, sensitivities of dipole resonance positions to bulk refractive index are found to depend only upon the wavelength of the resonance and the dielectric properties of the metal and the medium. Among particle plasmons that peak in the frequency range where the real part of the metal dielectric function varies linearly with wavelength and the imaginary part is small and slowly varying, the sensitivity of the peak wavelength, l*, to refractive index, n, is found to be a linearly increasing function of l*, regardless of the structural features of the particle that determine l*. Quasistatic theory is used to derive an analytical expression for the refractive index sensitivity of small particle plasmon peaks. Through this analysis, the dependence of sensitivity on band position is found to be determined by the wavelength dependence of the real part, , of the particle dielectric function, and the sensitivity results are found to extend to all particles with resonance conditions of the form, * = 2n2, where is a function of geometric parameters and other constants. The sensitivity results observed using accurate computational methods for dipolar plasmon bands of gold nanodisks, nanorods, and hollow nanoshells extend, therefore, to particles of other shapes (such as hexagonal and chopped tetrahedral), composed of other metals, and to higher-order modes. The bulk refractive index sensitivity yielded by the theory serves as an upper bound to sensitivities of nanoparticles on dielectric substrates and sensitivities of nanoparticles to local refractive index changes, such as those associated with biomolecule sensing.},

By comparing the experimental results with theoretical calculations based on the Mie theory, we demonstrate that the LSP polarization affects the peak and shape of the J-aggregate absorption band when the exciton resonance peak locates near the LSP resonance peak and when the separation of the J-aggregate from the metal surafce is short.

  abstract = {We present single molecule tip-enhanced resonance Raman spectra from brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) submonolayers adsorbed on a planar Au surface with Ag tips. A gap of 1 nm between a Ag tip and the Au substrate was employed to create a highly enhanced electric field and to generate Raman scattering from an area of \^a\textonequarter100 nm2. Three lines of evidence are presented to prove the single molecule sensitivity of our experiments: (1) Extremely diluted samples were used. Estimations show that at most a few molecules were excited by the Ag tip. (2) Spectroscopic fluctuations, including intensity fluctuations, frequency shifts, and line shape changes were observed. A histogram analysis of the intensity fluctuations of two different BCB coverages was carried out. The results clearly show the features of single molecule behavior. (3) Discrete signal losses also were observed. This is because of photochemical processes involving single molecules. Besides BCB, which shows a strong resonant absorption at 633 nm (the wavelength of the excitation laser), a self-assembled monolayer of benzenethiol, which does not strongly absorb at 633 nm, was studied. Good quality spectra were recorded with a short exposure time (10 s) and time-dependent spectral changes were also observed.},

  abstract = {We present a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) study of the size-dependence of the absorption and Raman scattering properties of pyridine interacting with small silver nanoclusters Ag-n (n = 2-8, 20). By employing a recently developed short-time approximation for the Raman scattering cross section we simulate both the normal and the "surface"-enhanced Raman spectra. The absorption spectra of the small silver clusters are studied both in the gas phase and embedded in rare gas matrices. We find that both the absorption and Raman properties depend strongly on cluster size and adsorption site. The normal Raman spectra of Ag-n-pyridine complexes resemble that of isolated pyridine, with enhancements which increase as cluster size increases. In contrast to this, both the enhancement and the appearance of the "surface"-enhanced Raman spectrum show a very strong dependence on cluster size. The total enhancements for the complexes are between 10(3) and 10(4) and quite surprisingly the strongest enhancement is found for the Ag-2-Py complex. However, the enhancement trends can be correlated with the distance of the molecule to the center of the metal cluster and with the resonance polarizability in a way that is suggestive of electromagnetic enhancements, so the enhancement mechanism for these small clusters is similar to what is found for larger particles.},

Extensive structural searches at several levels of density functional and ab initio theory revealed that the low-lying isomers of Au34- can be characterized as fluxional core\^ashell type structures with 4 or 3 inner atoms and 30 or 31 outer atoms, i.e., Au4@Au30- and Au3@Au31-, respectively. Detailed comparisons between theoretical and photoelectron results suggest that the most probable ground state structures of Au34- are of the Au4@Au30- type. The 30 outer atoms seem to be disordered or fluxional, giving rise to a number of low-lying isomers with very close energies and simulated photoelectron spectra. The fluxional nature of the outer layer in large gold clusters or nanoparticles may have important implications for their remarkable catalytic activities.},

Surface- and also tip-enhanced (resonance) Raman spectroscopy are becoming an interesting alternative to, in this respect, commonly employed fluorescence spectroscopy because of the much richer spectral information that is obtained from unmodified, label-free species. However, sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between the target molecule and contamination or decomposition of the sample, and unfortunately, it is not always ensured that the observed Raman features actually stem from the investigated species. The important question that arises in enhanced Raman studies addressed here is how to distinguish between the target molecule and the carbonaceous species.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth study of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) enhancement factors (EFs) and cross-sections, including several issues often overlooked. In particular, various possible rigorous definitions of the SERS EFs are introduced and discussed in the context of SERS applications, such as analytical chemistry and single molecule SERS. These definitions highlight the importance of a careful characterization of the non-SERS cross-sections of the probes under consideration. This aspect is illustrated by experimental results for the non-SERS cross-sections of representative SERS probes along with average SERS EFs for the same probes. In addition, the accurate experimental determination of single molecule enhancement factors is tackled with two recently developed techniques, namely: bi-analyte SERS (BiASERS) and temperature-dependent SERS vibrational pumping. We demonstrate that SERS EFs as low as 10(7), as opposed to the figure of 10(14) often claimed in the literature, are sufficient for the observation of single molecule SERS signals, with maximum single molecule EFs typically on the order of similar to 10(14).},

The clusters examined are size-selected via gel electrophoresis. Circular dichroism (CD) signals of the gold clusters (0.57 nm in the core diameter), whose sizes have been determined by a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, are practically temperature-dependent (20 and 40 \^A\textdegreeC), whereas ordinary absorption spectra are almost independent of the temperature. Furthermore, phase transfer of the gold clusters (0.57 nm) from water to toluene is successfully achieved by hydrophobization using ion association between tetraoctylammonium cations and carboxylate anions in surface penicillamine molecules. The phase-transferred clusters covered with d- or l-enantiomer still display intense optical activity with the opposite sign (mirror-image relationship) in the metal-based electronic transition region. Upon phase transfer, we find a significant change in the profiles of the anisotropy factor. On the basis of these temperature- and phase-dependent chiroptical behaviors of the gold clusters, we discuss the origins of their optical activity in the context of a dissymmetric field model.},

  abstract = {Using density functional theory, we have studied the interactions between pyridine (Py) and coinage metals (silver, copper, and gold) as well as the transition metal platinum. We present here a detailed analysis of the influence of chemical enhancement effects on the SERS signals. We analyze the differential Raman scattering cross sections of the a, vibrational modes related to Py. The results show that the relative Raman intensities of SERS spectra depend strongly on the binding interaction between Py and the SERS active centers, the electronic property of metal materials, and the incident wavelengths. When the bonding between Py and a SERS site is very weak, analogous to physical adsorption, the Raman spectra of the adsorbed Py are similar to that of free Py. For Py interacting strongly with copper, gold, and platinum, clusters, we find that the Raman intensities of the nu(1), nu(6), nu(9a), and nu(8a) modes of Py are enhanced, whereas the intensity of the nu(12) mode decreases. To check the enhancement effect of the charge-transfer mechanism, we calculate the preresonance Raman spectra. For Py interacting with silver, copper, and gold clusters, the low-lying charge transfer states are formed from the valence shell s orbital of metal to the unoccupied pi*-type orbitals (b(1) and a(2)) of the Py ring; whereas for Py adsorbed on platinum clusters, the low-lying charge transfer states are formed due to the transitions from some d orbitals of the metal clusters to the two unoccupied pi*-type orbitals of Py. The results show that the Raman spectral property depends strongly on the property of these excited states and the electronic structures of the metal materials.},

  abstract = {We present a unified expression for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The expression contains a product of three resonance denominators, representing the surface plasmon resonance, the metal-molecule charge-transfer resonance at the Fermi energy, and an allowed molecular resonance. This latter resonance is that from which intensity is borrowed for charge transfer, and when the molecular resonance is active it is responsible for surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy. We examine this expression in various limits, to explore the relative contribution or each resonance. First, we look at the situation in which only the surface plasmon resonance is active and examine the various contributions to the Raman signal, including the surface selection rules. Then we examine additional contributions from charge-transfer or molecular resonances. We show that the three resonances are not totally independent, since they are linked by a product of four matrix elements in the numerator. These linked matrix elements provide comprehensive selection rules for SERS. One involves a harmonic oscillator in the observed normal mode. This is the same mode which appears in the vibronic coupling operator linking one of the states of the allowed molecular resonance to the charge-transfer state. The charge-transfer transition moment is linked to the surface plasmon resonance by the requirement that the transition dipole moment be polarized along the direction of maximum amplitude of the field produced by the plasmon (i.e., perpendicular to the metal surface). We show that these selection rules govern the observed SERS spectral intensities and apply these to the observed spectra of several molecules. We also suggest a quantitative measure of the degree to which charge transfer contributes to the overall SERS enhancement.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In this work the influence of geometry and composition on the charge-induced plasmonic shifts (CIPS) of gold nanoparticles are systematically studied using Mie scattering theory and the discrete dipole approximation. The sensitivity of nanorods and nanodisks with different aspect ratio and nanoshells with different volume fractions and compositions are studied using different charging levels. The electrodynamics calculations were performed by changing the internal electron density in the Drude model for the dielectric constant of gold. We show that, for a constant volume, nanodisks and nanorods exhibit CIPS with a linear dependence on aspect ratio. Geometries having higher aspect ratio show larger CIPS. In nanoshells, increasing the volume fraction of the core causes a slow increase of CIPS at first followed by a rapid increase for larger volume fractions. In addition, we find that nanoshells with the same volume fractions exhibit larger shifts when the refractive index of the cores is larger. Furthermore, the electrodynamics results are interpreted using analytical approximations based on quasistatic theory. The qualitative understanding of geometric and composition effects on the CIPS of gold nanoparticles obtained in this work can hopefully be used to realize highly tunable charge-based active plasmonic devices.},

  abstract = {Alizarin is one of the dyes extensively investigated as an example of a molecule capable of serving as a light absorber and an electron donor in model systems designed for the new type solar cells. Using the Stark effect measurements for alizarin, both free in solution and adsorbed to TiO2 nanoparticles, the question has been addressed whether the excited-state orbital of adsorbed alizarin extends into the solid and involves the orbitals of the Ti atom or remains localized within the alizarin molecule. Because an important role can be played by the electric field at the charged surface of the nanoparticles, the field was modulated by changing the pH of the medium. The results reveal a substantial dipole moment change on the electronic excitation of the alizarin−TiO2 system, |$\Delta$$\mu$| ≈ 10 Debye units or slightly more. The observed dependence of the absorption maximum and the measured |$\Delta$$\mu$| on pH were used to distinguish between $\Delta$$\mu$ directed toward the nanoparticle surface and that corresponding to the intrinsic rearrangement of electrons within alizarin or, in reverse direction, corresponding to more- or less-complete electron transfer from alizarin onto the orbitals of Ti and adjacent atoms comprising a localized surface (or a delocalized conductive) state. The results qualitatively contradict a significant dye-to-solid charge-transfer character of the electronic transition. It is shown that they can be interpreted in a self-consistent way by considering, in a first approximation, the light absorption by alizarin monoanion subject to the electric field generated by the charged nanoparticle surface.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper provides a brief overview of recent research activities concerning metal nanomaterials, including their synthesis, structure, surface plasmon absorption, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), electron dynamics, emerging applications, and the historical context by which to view these subjects. We emphasize coinage metals, particularly silver and gold. Silver and gold nanostructures exhibit fascinating optical properties due to their strong optical absorption in the visible as a result of the collective oscillation of conduction band electrons, known as the surface plasmon. This is the origin of many interesting physical phenomena and related applications such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and SERS useful in chemical and biomedical detection and analysis. SERS offers high sensitivity and molecular specificity that are attractive for sensing and imaging applications. Electron dynamics in metal nanostructures have been studied using ultrafast laser techniques to gain fundamental insight into electronphonon interaction as well as coherent lattice oscillation in different metal nanostructures. Relevant theoretical work and models are also discussed in conjunction with the related experimental work. Synthesis and structural characterization are also discussed to make this paper self-contained and easier to follow. The paper ends with some emerging applications of optical properties of metal nanomaterials including photothermal therapy for cancer.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Aggregation behavior of colloidal silver nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) on a hydrophobic surface is investigated. A regular glass slide is used to deposit dicholoromethylsilane in order to inactivate the free hydroxyl groups and increase the hydrophobicity of the glass surface. A submicron volume of colloidal suspension is spotted on the hydrophobic surface. During the evaporation of water from the droplet, the nanoparticles start to form aggregates with a definite size and shape. Increasing colloidal suspension concentration by more than 4 times helped to complete the size of silver nanoparticles aggregates to about 1 OEm diameter. The SERS activity of aggregates was investigated using Rhodamine 6G as a probe. The aggregates formed from higher colloidal suspension concentrations show a significant improvement in SERS activity. The SERS enhancement on the aggregates formed on hydrophobic surfaces is at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the disordered aggregates prepared on the regular glass surface using the same colloidal suspension. The SERS enhancement factor for the aggregates and the limit of detection (LOD) for Rhodamine 6G are estimated as about 3 x 105 and 1.0 x 105, respectively. The percent coefficient of variance (CV) improved about 300% by increasing the colloidal suspension concentration 8-fold on the prepared aggregates. A minimum 2-fold increase in SERS enhancement on the aggregates prepared from silver colloidal suspension containing NaCl and SDS is also observed.},

The SERS spectra of CO2 on copper films deposited at 40 K display neutral species at SERS active sites with bands not observed by Raman spectroscopy of CO2 gas, but identical to the loss bands of gaseous CO2 in electron energy loss spectroscopy. The absence of one component of the Fermi doublet of CO2 in SERS proves that the local electromagnetic field enhancement at SERS active sites cannot deliver signals above the noise level. The activated anionic CO2 is observed by transient electron transfer from the anionic molecule to the copper metal at a subgroup of SERS active sites, which are annealed below 200 K. The IRRAS spectra show only the expected infrared (IR) active modes of neutral CO2 representing the majority species of adsorbed CO2.},

  abstract = { We use the finite-difference time-domain method to predict how fluorescence is modified if the fluorophore is located between two silver nanoparticles of a dimer system. The fluorophore is modeled as a radiating point dipole with orientation defined by its polarization. When a fluorophore is oriented perpendicular to the metal surface, there is a large increase in total power radiated through a closed surface containing the dimer system, in comparison to the isolated fluorophore and the case of a fluorophore near a single nanoparticle. The increase in radiated power indicates increases in the relative radiative decay rates of the emission near the nanoparticles. The angle-resolved far-field distributions of the emission in a single plane are also computed. This is informative as many experimental conditions involve collection optics and detectors that collect the emission along a single plane. For fluorophores oriented perpendicular to the metal surfaces, the dimer systems lead to significant enhancements in the fluorescence emission intensity in the plane. In contrast, significant emission quenching occurs if the fluorophores are oriented parallel to the metal surfaces. We also examine the effect of the fluorophore on the near-field around the nanoparticles and correlate our results with surface plasmon excitations. },

For the Ag20 cluster, the convergence properties of the spectra with respect to basis set and density functional are examined, and the most accurate results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The Agn spectra evolve from molecular-like to plasmon-like with increasing n, and from this we are able to extrapolate the plasmon energy and width to the large particle limit, leading to results that are in excellent agreement with continuum electrodynamics results. The results show that for the selected tetrahedral clusters, the plasmon width does not increase with decreasing cluster size as is commonly found (or assumed) for typical cluster shape distributions.},

  abstract = {The interaction between proteins and the surfaces of inorganic materials is of great importance in natural systems and a long studied topic. What is yet to be fully understood is the mechanism that determines such interactions, in particular, for a given surface, which aminoacid, if any, binds and, in that case, what is the nature of the binding. The Au(111) surface, due to its utilization in several bioelectronics and biological applications, is one of the most commonly used substrates for experimental investigations. Among others, various experimental results have shown a clear affinity between the natural aminoacid histidine and the gold surface. Because the main contribution to the protein-surface interaction is likely mediated by the solvent accessible sidechains, we have focused our attention on imidazole, the molecule representing histidine side chain. Plane waves DFT calculations, in the supercell approach, have been performed to evaluate the nature of the interaction. Our results indicate the presence of a ``on top'' adsorption geometry with a covalent contribution to the binding between the unprotonated nitrogen atom and the superficial gold atom directly below it.},

  abstract = {In this work we have presented a capacitance-polarizability interaction model for describing the polarizability of large metal clusters. The model consists of interacting atomic capacitances and polarizabilities that are optimized to reproduce the full polarizability tensors of medium sized (N d 68) gold and silver clusters. The reference polarizability tensors have been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory and shown good agreement with experimental results. We have shown that very good agreement between the model and the DFT results can be achieved both for the isotropic and anisotropic polarizability as a function of size, thus providing an accurate description of the polarizability of noble metal clusters. The model is computationally efficient and can easily handle cluster several nm in radius, thus, provides a natural bridge between the quantum mechanical methods and the macroscopic electrodynamic description. This allowed us to study the polarizability of silver and gold clusters having different shapes, i.e., spheres, rods, and disks, and sizes having diameters as large as 4.5 nm, thus, reaching the saturation of the polarizability. By partitioning the total polarizability into effective atomic polarizabilities that depend on the atomic position in the cluster, we provide a physical picture of the saturation of the polarizability of metal clusters as a function of size. This illustrates that the onset of the saturation occurs as the cluster starts to have a core of atoms showing bulk-like polarizabilities, surrounded by layers of atoms with surface-like polarizabilities. For larger clusters we see that the bulk core grows whereas the surface layers keep roughly the same thickness thus leading to a saturation of the polarizability as the size of the cluster increases.},

The field enhancement factors were calculated for spherical metal nanoparticles and nanoshells in the quasistatic limit using empirical wavelength-dependent dielectric constants. Dependence of the field enhancement factor on various parameters, such as wavelength, distance from the nanoparticle/nanoshell, metal element, dielectric core material, surrounding medium, and diameter ratio between the core and the shell, was investigated. Interestingly the peak field enhancement factor becomes largest with core-to-shell diameter ratio at $\sim$0.9 for any combination of noble metal shell and dielectric core. As a consequence of the parameter optimization, it was found that an Ag nanoshell with a Teflon core with a core/shell diameter ratio of 0.88 exhibits a peak field enhancement factor of 1400 in its vicinity in water.},

A theoretical model is built by using a quantum chemistry based Landauer theory combined with Green's function formalism and the D'Amato-Pastawski model to describe the electronic conduction in the presence of incoherent scattering effects. Effects of incoherent transport on the total conductance under the nonbiased, stationary, and nondissipative conditions are investigated. Calculation results with the Newns-Anderson approximation show that the distance dependence of electron conduction through molecular wires smoothly interpolates the transition of the dominant transporting mechanism from coherent tunneling with the exponential decay in short distance to incoherent tunneling associated with sequential hopping with weak distance dependence.},

  abstract = {In this work, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of energetically stable chiral structures for bare gold clusters. Density functional theory calculations within the generalized-gradient approximation were performed to systematically study structural, vibrational, electronic, and optical properties of the lowest-lying isomers of the Au34Z, (Z = +1, 0, -1), clusters. Our results show that for the neutral and charged clusters, the lowest-energy isomer has a C1 (chiral) structure. In addition, a C3 (chiral) isomer was found nearly degenerate in energy with the C1 isomer. These results are in agreement with previous theoretical-experimental studies done for the Au34- cluster; however, because our calculated molecular scattering functions for the C1 and C3 isomers of this cluster are almost indistinguishable, it is concluded that the actual resolution in trapped ion electron diffraction experiments is not enough to discriminate between them. On the other hand, the electronic density of states of the C1 isomer shows better overall agreement with the measured photoelectron spectrum of the Au34- cluster than that one corresponding to the C3 isomer. The electronic density of states of these isomers also shows different features in the energy region of the HOMO--LUMO gap, which would generate distinct behavior in their optical properties. In fact, the calculated absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the two chiral isomers show clear differences in their line shape. Another important property that distinguishes the C1 and C3 isomers is the different spatial distribution of the atomic coordination on the cluster surface. Our results confirm that the potential energy surface of bare gold clusters could have lowest-lying energy minima corresponding to intrinsically chiral structures.},

  abstract = {Surface chemical properties of metal nanoparticles must be tunable to create chemical specificity and are a key prerequisite for successful sensing and imaging platforms. To relate surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to electrostatic field force, a simple colloidal chemistry approach has been deliberately exploited for syntheses of gold nanoparticles with negative and positive surface charges to study their interactions with charged analytes. We took up the challenge with sulfur-containing analytes because AuS interaction is well-known. Thiocyanate ion, SCN, a well-known SERS analyte, has been proved to be chemically ligated/anchored on positively charged gold nanoparticles surface owing to favorable electrostatic attraction. The AuS vibrational band at 240 cm1 and blue-shifting of the CN stretching frequency by 46 cm1 in conjunction with its intensity enhancement by an order of 103 in the SERS spectrum clearly illustrate a chemisorption phenomenon. In contrast, physisorption of the SCN ion becomes evident on negatively charged colloid. Again, methylene blue has been shown to remain engrossed on the negatively charged gold surfaces. However, the electrostatic field force could not be accounted for from fluorescence quenching while methylaminopyrene was introduced because of the distance-dependence effect. The feasibility of such coordinative/chemical attachment also has been examined theoretically by density functional theory (DFT). Moreover, employment of this DFT calculation has been performed on five different metal molecule interaction models to fruitfully interpret the experimental SERS findings and also the orientation of the SERS analyte. The observed Raman signals have been assigned from the potential energy distributions in terms of internal coordinates of adsorbate from the output of DFT calculations. The results thus provide a benchmark illustration of the value of DFT for aiding interpretation of adsorbate vibrational spectra attainable by using SERS.},

A monolayer of tris(2,2-bipyridine)-ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) was introduced to the NSL Ag nanoparticles, and its effect on the LSPR was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. Wavelength-scanned surface-enhanced resonance Raman excitation spectroscopy (WS SERRES) profiles of Ru(bpy)32+ adsorbed on Ag nanoparticle arrays were measured for excitation wavelengths in the range of 400-500 nm. The WS SERRES profiles are correlated, both spatially and spectrally, with the corresponding LSPR spectra of the nanoparticle arrays and with the solution absorption spectrum of Ru(bpy)32+. The WS SERRES profile peak position depends on the relative spectral position of LSPR and the molecular resonance. Quasi-static electrodynamics modeling was applied to simulate the WS SERRES profiles, and the calculations are in agreement with the experimental results, demonstrating that the WS SERRES profiles involve multiplicative electromagnetic and resonance Raman enhancements.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering from molecules adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles has been observed. This is attributed to the dominant contribution of the TiO2-to-molecule charge-transfer mechanism. The charge-transfer process is largely dependent on the intrinsic nature of the adsorbed molecules and the surface properties of the semiconductor. Both the stronger electron attracting ability of groups para- to the mercapto group bonded with TiO2 surface and the plentiful surface states of TiO2 nanoparticles are favorable to TiO2-to-molecule charge-transfer and SERS for molecules adsorbed on TiO2.},

  abstract = {Applying the method of density functional theory calculations, we examine the Raman and surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of crystal violet. The resulting optimized structure is of point symmetry D3, and the calculated Raman spectrum provides an excellent match with the observed normal Raman spectrum. This provides a reliable assignment of the symmetry and normal modes of the observed spectrum, which consists of bands assigned to modes of either a1 or e symmetry. The e modes are not split, showing that D3 symmetry remains, even on the surface. The SERS spectra, both normal and single-molecule, are dominated by the nontotally symmetric e vibrations, which are preferentially enhanced in accord with the Herzberg-Teller-surface selection rules. The mechanism involves intensity borrowing through vibronic coupling between a charge-transfer state and the lowest-lying $\pi-\pi^\ast$ transition. A quantitative measure of the degree of charge transfer is obtained by analyzing the potential dependence of SERS intensities. This indicates a considerable contribution of charge-transfer intensity to the overall SERS enhancement.},

The results account for experimentally observed continuous change from decreased to increased fluorescence. The changes are described as the effects of a dependence on the distance and orientation between the chromophore and the metal nanoparticle, as well as the size, shape, number, and type of the metal particles and the influence of the solvent. The chromophore investigated was N,N'-dimethylperylene-3,4,9,10-dicarboximide in combination with silver and gold particles. The study explains and rationalizes how intrinsic characteristics of the metal predetermine the nanoparticle's behavior toward chromophore excitation and decay rates.

  abstract = {Analysis of the bandwidth of the Clausius-Mosotti local field factor challenges the standard assumption that both incident and scattered fields are equally enhanced in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The most common geometry for observation of SERS is on a nanoparticle or nanostructure where the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) field enhancement arises from the electromagnetic environment produced by scattering off the conductor surface. Consequently, the electric field enhancement experienced by an adsorbate on the metal surface is a function of the magnitude of the transition dipole moment of the nanoparticle or nanostructure. Even in the treatment that considers the conducting nanostructure and molecule interactions as contributions to a collective scattering process, analytical expressions based on the Drude free-electron model reveal the importance of the bandwidth of the local field factor as a limitation on the SERS enhancement. These model calculations based on the Drude model are confirmed herein by explicit calculation using the dielectric functions for Au and Ag. The enhancement bandwidth depends on the ratio of the plasma frequency, p and the damping, , such that the greater the enhancement ratio, p/, the narrower the enhancement bandwidth. The relationship of the Raman shift to the enhancement bandwidth places severe constraints on the theoretical enhancement possible by the electromagnetic mechanism.},

The TPA spectra of the chromophores measured by the femtosecond open-aperture Z-scan method reveal that the double-bond core results in much more intense TPA than the triple-bond one, with a significant red shift of the TPA peak while the TPA becomes more intense as the chain is extended for the triple-bond core compounds with a little red shift.

We compare the experimental photothermal transduction efficiencies with the theoretical absorption efficiencies for each nanoparticle type. Our analysis assumes a distribution of randomly oriented nanorods, as would occur naturally in the tumor vasculature. In our study, photothermal transduction efficiencies differed by a factor of 3 or less between the different types of nanoparticle studied. Both experiment and theory show that particle size plays a dominant role in determining transduction efficiency, with larger particles more efficient for both absorption and scattering, enabling simultaneous photothermal heating and bioimaging contrast enhancement.},

Single- and multicomponent fixed-bed experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 125 to 175 \textdegreeC and total hydrocarbon pressures up to 0.10 bar. At high pressure, the adsorption capacity for all the components varies from 35 to 26 g/100 gads at 125 and 175 \textdegreeC. Henry?s constants are slightly different for all C8 alkylaromatics, except for o-xylene, which is significantly higher. The adsorption enthalpies at zero coverage for the different isomers ranges from 77.40 (eb) to 79.84 kJ/mol (o-x), indicating that the C8 alkylaromatics have comparable interactions with the framework at the low coverage. On the basis of binary and quaternary breakthrough experiments performed at different hydrocarbon pressures and temperatures, MOF Zn(BDC)(Dabco)0.5 was realized for the efficient and feasible separation of o-xylene from other C8 alkylaromatic components with the selectivity up to 1.88 because of the stronger interactions between o-xylene molecules and the framework and their differential pore-filling and molecular-packing effects confined within nanopores of MOFs.},

The model consists of interacting atom-type capacitances and polarizabilities that combined describe the total response of the nanoclusters. A double Lorentzian oscillator is used to describe the frequency-dependent atomic polarizabilities, while a single Lorentzian oscillator is used to describe the frequency-dependent atomic capacitances. All atomic parameters have been optimized using reference data obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. As a comprehensive test of our model, we have studied the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of quasi-spherical silver nanoclusters having different structural motifs, i.e., icosahedra, truncated Ino and Marks decahedra, and regular truncated octahedra and cubocahedra. We have shown that clusters in all five structural motifs exhibit a strong absorption peak in the spectral region of 2.4−4.8 eV, although the size evolution of absorption peak location and peak width depends strongly on the number of atoms and the atomic arrangements of the clusters.},

SERS signals of 4-MBA molecules adsorbed on Ag--TiO2 NPs were further enhanced considerably relative to those enhancements on pure TiO2 NPs. The surface-deposited Ag on TiO2 can inject additional electrons into molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface through the conduction band of TiO2 NPs because of plasmon resonance absorption of Ag under incident visible laser, besides the intrinsic TiO2-to-molecule charge-transfer (CT) contribution. The two contributions mentioned are responsible for the whole SERS intensity of the molecules adsorbed on Ag--TiO2 NPs. This work is valuable in developing nanosized TiO2 used as a promising, nontoxic and biologically compatible SERS-active substrate as well as in studying the CT mechanism between Ag and TiO2 for potential photoelectrochemical applications.},

  abstract = {We present the absolute resonance Raman scattering (RRS) intensities of uracil, rhodamine 6G (R6G), and iron(II) porphyrin with imidazole and CO ligands (FePImCO) calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The spectra are calculated using both the vibronic theory and the short-time approximation. We find that the absolute RRS intensities calculated using the short-time approximation are severely overestimated, as compared with results obtained using the vibronic theory. This issue is attributed to the sensitivity of the absolute RRS intensities to the adjustable damping factor within the short-time approximation. This is illustrated for uracil, for which the relative intensities were predicted accurately using the short-time approximation, but the absolute intensities were still overestimated. Although intensities comparable to that obtained with the vibronic theory could be obtained using the short-time approximation, it requires a large damping factor, roughly twice that estimated from the absorption spectrum, to be used in the simulations. Furthermore, we find that DFT underestimates the absolute RRS intensities for R6G as compared to experiments, which is most likely due to the neglect of solvent effects in the calculations. For R6G and FePImCO, vibronic effects are shown to enhance the low-frequency modes relatively more, improving the agreement with experiments.},

The band assigned to the symmetric NO2 stretch of the nitro form of nitrite appeared at around 1300 cm−1 in both solutions. The potential dependence of the spectra revealed that this adsorbed nitrite is converted to NO adsorbed at on-top, bridge, and defect sites via IR-inactive surface nitrite species. In 0.1 M HClO4, these three adsorbed NO species were also formed during the adsorption process from the solution NO formed by the disproportionation of nitrite. In addition to the reduction via the IR-inactive surface nitrite species, a direct conversion from adsorbed nitrite to adsorbed NO was also suggested in 0.1 M HClO4.},

Special attention is paid to the dependence of backscatter circular polarization difference signals on molecular direction from the spherical nanoparticle and to the conditions that ensure the differences occur only for molecules of chiral character. Dual circular polarization strategies are determined to have special advantages in these circumstances, and the corresponding excitation profiles for a simple chiroptical model are analyzed in detail to suggest preferred excitation wavelengths.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of benzoate recorded on silver electrode have been analyzed on the basis of a charge transfer (CT) enhancement mechanism similar to a resonance Raman (RR) process where a photoinduced electron transfer between a metal and an adsorbate takes place. Given that benzoic acid (BzH) is adsorbed on silver as benzoate anion (), this resonant CT process implies the transient formation of the corresponding radical dianion (). The dependence of the relative SERS intensities on the electrode potential has been analyzed on the basis of ab initio calculations of the electronic properties of the isolated adsorbate in its ground and excited CT states (, respectively). Moreover, configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations have also been carried out for the Ag2-benzoate () supermolecule, which shows two excited singlets, namely CT0;1B1 and CT1;1A2, where the properties of the adsorbate are quite similar to those of the radical dianion of the isolated species. The theoretical calculations predict the selective enhancement of modes 8a and -) under CT resonant conditions in close agreement with the SERS results. This confirms once again the relevance of resonant CT processes in the SERS of aromatic molecules and the usefulness of this technique in the study of very unstable species such as radical anions or dianions of aromatic adsorbates.},

We test the theory by comparison with the observed profiles in pyridine, p-aminothiopehnol (PATP), and an azo dye (DABS). The experimental profiles are clearly asymmetric, dipping into the continuum on one side and approaching the continuum asymptotically on the other.

  abstract = {A new multiscale computational methodology was developed to effectively incorporate the scattered electric field of a plasmonic nanoparticle into a quantum mechanical (QM) optical property calculation for a nearby dye molecule. For a given location of the dye molecule with respect to the nanoparticle, a frequency-dependent scattering response function was first determined by the classical electrodynamics (ED) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach. Subsequently, the time-dependent scattered electric field at the dye molecule was calculated using the FDTD scattering response function through a multidimensional Fourier transform to reflect the effect of polarization of the nanoparticle on the local field at the molecule. Finally, a real-time time-dependent density function theory (RT-TDDFT) approach was employed to obtain a desired optical property (such as absorption cross section) of the dye molecule in the presence of the nanoparticle's scattered electric field. Our hybrid QM/ED methodology was demonstrated by investigating the absorption spectrum of the N3 dye molecule and the Raman spectrum of pyridine, both of which were shown to be significantly enhanced by a 20 nm diameter silver sphere. In contrast to traditional quantum mechanical optical calculations in which the field at the molecule is entirely determined by intensity and polarization direction of the incident light, in this work we show that the light propagation direction as well as polarization and intensity are important to nanoparticle-bound dye molecule response. At no additional computation cost compared to conventional ED and QM calculations, this method provides a reliable way to couple the response of the dye molecule's individual electrons to the collective dielectric response of the nanoparticle.},

  abstract = {A combination of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA), surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to explore the adsorption of the cyanobenzoic acid (CBA) isomers on evaporated silver films and a silver powder. All substrates exhibited the nanoscale roughness appropriate for SERS and SEIRA enhancement. SERS and DFT demonstrated that each of the CBA isomers adsorbed to a silver film as a carboxylate ion. The impact of resonance effects in SERS spectra among the different CBA isomers was discussed. For 2-cyanobenzoic acid (2CBA), the DFT calculated dipole moment was 5.87 D, for 3-cyanobenzoic acid (3CBA), the dipole moment was 5.31 D, and for 4-cyanobenzoic acid (4CBA), the dipole moment was 3.57 D. It was shown with SEIRA that 3CBA and 2CBA underwent significant ionization in the multilayer when deposition occurred using an alkane solvent with nonpolar bonds. 4CBA adsorption was not impacted by the polar properties of the deposition solvent because 4CBA had a smaller dipole moment than 2CBA and 3CBA which induced less attraction to the underlying silver nanostructures. A comparison of the SEIRA results on silver films versus silver powder highlighted the importance of the nanoscale nature of the silver substrate on film growth during deposition of the CBA isomers. Details of the TPD spectra of each of the CBA isomers on the silver powder were also outlined. It is anticipated that this work will have a significant impact in areas of nanotechnology, applied physics, biochemistry, and organic synthesis where benzonitrile chemistry is important.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to understand the single-molecule SERS of some small nonresonant molecules, such as adenine, it is inevitable to include the chemical enhancement mechanism to provide additional enhancement to the electromagnetic mechanism, although it may be much smaller than the electromagnetic field enhancement. We will report here the first experimental investigation of the charge-transfer (CT) enhancement of protonated adenine molecules on Rh and Pd by performing the potential-dependent SERS using one UV laser (325 nm) and two visible lasers (514.5 and 632.8 nm). A UV laser displays a significant role in the verification of the CT process due to its much larger photon energy and thus a much larger shift of potential of the maximum SERS intensity (Emax) than visible lasers. We find a well-discernible Emax and a linear relationship between Emax and the photon energy of the laser for adenine on both Rh and Pd surfaces. The Emax was found to shift positively with the increasing photon energy, which strongly indicates an electron transfer from the Ef of Rh and Pd to the lowest unoccupied orbital of adenine molecules. In addition, different contributions of CT enhancement to adenine Raman bands are also briefly discussed. By analyzing the wavelength-dependent intensity change and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, we propose the contribution of preresonance Raman enhancement to the UV-SERS signal for the band at around 1330 cm-1. The present study demonstrates that the use of a UV laser opens a promising way to understand the enhancement mechanism, especially the chemical enhancement mechanism.},

A large Raman cross-section enhancement factor (EF) of 106 was obtained with plasmon resonant excitation on the Au array, and the EF decreases with off-resonant excitations. However, for Pt nanodisks the experimental EF is much smaller (102) and not sensitive to excitation wavelength. Electric field intensities calculated in Au and Pt nanoparticles using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) with a dielectric function including or excluding interband transitions allowed us to explain the SERS EF differences at different excitation wavelengths. The observed SERS insensitivity to excitation wavelength in Pt was explained using Fano interference between the free plasmon electrons and continuum interband transitions. The importance of Fano interference was explored analytically in the electrostatic limit by varying the contribution from the interband transitions.},

This article uses composition-tunable colloidal Au--Cu nanoparticles as a model system for exploring the issue of reliable experimental determination of composition in plasmonic alloy nanoparticles and correlation of this experimental data with theoretical predictions. Highly uniform spherical Au1-xCux alloy nanoparticles were synthesized with compositions ranging from x = 0 to 0.5. The particle compositions were analyzed independently using both powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which represent two of the most common nanoparticle composition analysis techniques. The plasmon resonance frequencies, determined experimentally for each sample using UV--vis spectroscopy, red shift with increasing copper content as expected. These experimentally determined plasmon resonance frequencies were then compared to the values predicted theoretically based upon the XRD and EDS composition measurements. Although EDS and XRD are both found to be acceptable methods for experimentally determining the composition, careful data analysis suggests that XRD composition measurements are more accurate for smaller values of x, whereas EDS measurements are more accurate for larger values of x. In addition, some discrepancies between the experimentally determined plasmon resonance frequencies and those predicted by theory suggest inaccuracies in using a simple linear mixing rule to determine the dielectric constant of the Au--Cu alloys.},

Herein, we report a seeded growth mechanism for the formation of silver nanoparticles that allows superior control over the size of the resultant nanoparticles with relatively low polydispersity. The high degree of size control allows for a better understanding of the study of the effect of particle size on SERS intensity. The Raman study performed here employed a long-wavelength excitation (785 nm) so as to avoid photochemical degradation of adsorbed species and photochemical transformation under intense excitation. Under these experimental conditions, it was found that the optimal size of AgNPs for providing a maximum SERS intensity of adsorbed R6G is 50-60 nm, a result that is expected to extend to other adsorbates as well.},

On top of this, when the nanoparticle array is immersed in a solvent or in a dielectric matrix, the environment is modifying the position and the intensity of the single-particle plasmon resonances and also their coupling. In this article, by means of a hybrid quantum-mechanical/continuum model, we study the consequences of solvent effects and plasmon couplings on the fluorescence intensity of a dye (naphthalene monoimide) positioned within a four-metal nanoparticle square array. In particular, we analyze the effects of the metal nature (Ag vs Au), interparticle distance, dye-particle distance, dye orientation, and addition of a solvent (dimethylformamide) on the surface-enhanced fluorescence intensity of the dye and on the various quantities that determine such enhancement (radiative and nonradiative decay times, absorption). The conditions that make the effects of the four particles additive are explored, and the results of the hybrid model are tested against those of a fully quantum mechanical model for a dye plus two metal clusters (Ag20) system.},

  abstract = {Two-photon active green fluorescent protein -type chromophores were successfully synthesized following investigations directed toward a modified version of zFP538 chromophore, a structural analogue to the GFP-chromophore. A generalized approach for the chromophore synthesis via a well-studied cycloaddition reaction combining an iminoglycine methyl ester and a substituted benzaldehyde was developed allowing for flexibility in the incorporation of functional groups such as donor\^aacceptor substituents and for additional groups to provide extended conjugation. Steady-state spectroscopy, fluorescence quantum yields, and time-resolved fluorescence lifetimes for synthesized chromophores were extensively investigated for the functionalized chromophores. Time-resolved fluorescence lifetimes were found to be biexponential generally with subpicosecond and picosecond components. The individual effects of substitution position of functional groups and relative bulk size were evaluated and found to be rather significant in changing the fluorescence-decay characteristics in the case of positioning, but ambiguous with respect to relative bulk. The GFP-type chromophores were found to possess modest to low two-photon absorption cross sections with the dimethylamino-substituted analogue possessing the largest value at nearly 40 GM. These molecules show promise as biological markers for application in the study of conformation changes and aggregation of amyloid peptides, known to play an important role in many neurodegenerative diseases.},

SERS provides spectroscopic detection of single molecules, and FSRS enables the acquisition of Raman spectra on the ultrafast time scale of molecular motion. Here, we present the first successful combination of these two techniques, demonstrating surface-enhanced femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SE-FSRS) using gold nanoantennas with embedded reporter molecules. Using a picosecond Raman and femtosecond probe pulse, the time- and ensemble-averaged enhancement factor is estimated to be in the range of 10^4-10^6. We report the line shapes, power dependence, and magnitude of the SE-FSRS signal and discuss contributions to sample degradation on the minute time scale. With these first successful proof-of-principle experiments, time-resolved SE-FSRS techniques can now be rationally attempted with the goals of investigating the dynamics of plasmonic materials as well as examining the contributions of environmental heterogeneities by probing more homogeneous molecular subsets.},

The latter mechanism proceeds by increased electron-photon coupling at an atomically rough surface and by temporary charge transfer to orbitals of the adsorbates.

  abstract = {We use a charge-dipole interaction model to study the polarizability of aromatic molecules that are placed between two silver clusters. In particular we examine the enhancement in polarizability induced by the clusters at plasmon-like resonant frequencies of the cluster-molecule-cluster system. The model used for these simulations relies on representation of the atoms by both a net electric charge and a dipole. By relating the time variation of the atomic charges to the currents that flow through the bonds of the structures considered, a least-action principle can be formulated that enables the atomic charges and dipoles to be determined. We consider benzene, naphthalene and anthracene for this study, comparing the polarizability of these aromatic molecules when placed in the middle between two Ag120 clusters, with their polarizability as isolated molecules. We find that the polarizability of these molecules is enhanced by the clusters, and this increases the electromagnetic coupling between the two clusters. This results in significant red-shifting (by up to 0.8 eV) of the lowest energy optical transition in the cluster-molecule-cluster system compared to plasmon-like excitation in the cluster-cluster system. The resulting resonant polarizability enhancement leads to an electromagnetic enhancement in surface-enhanced Raman scattering of over 106.},

Improving fluorescence sensitivity, all the way to the limit of single-molecular detection needed in many applications, remains a great challenge. The technique of surface enhanced fluorescence (SEF) is based upon the design of surfaces in the vicinity of the emitter. SEF yields an overall improvement in the fluorescence detection efficiency through modification and control of the local electromagnetic environment of the emitter. Near-field coupling between the emitter and surface modes plays a crucial role in SEF. In particular, plasmonic surfaces with localized and propagating surface plasmons are efficient SEF substrates. Recent progress in tailoring surfaces at the nanometre scale extends greatly the realm of SEF applications. This review focuses on the recent advances in the different mechanisms involved in SEF, in each case highlighting the most relevant applications.},

However, density-functional techniques have their limitations, including the ability to satisfactorily describe dispersion interactions. Given the ubiquitous nature of dispersion in chemical and biological systems, this is not a trivial matter. Recent advances in the development of DFT methods can treat dispersion. These include dispersion-corrected DFT (using explicit, attractive dispersion terms), parameterized functionals, and dispersion-correcting potentials, all of which can dramatically improve performance for dispersion-bound species. In this perspective, we highlight the achievements made in modeling dispersion using DFT. We hope that this will provide valuable insight to both computational chemists and experimentalists, who aim to study physical processes driven by dispersion interactions.},

The present study investigated the two-photon excited PDT performing in vitro experiments where C6 rat glioma cells were irradiated with a pulsed and focused fs Ti:sapphire laser emitting light at 800 nm. The irradiance distribution of the laser beam was carefully analyzed before the experiment and the applied irradiance was known for each position within the irradiated cell layer. Cells were divided into four groups and one group was incubated with 5-ALA and irradiated 4-5 h later. The survival of this group was tested after irradiation by means of ethidium bromide and acridine orange staining and compared to a control group, which was irradiated under the same conditions, but not incubated with 5-ALA before. Both groups showed necrotic areas depending on the applied irradiance, the value of which at the margin of the necrotic area could be deduced from its size. 5-ALA incubated cells became necrotic after irradiation with a mean irradiance above 6.1 \texttimes 1010 W/cm2, while non-incubated cells remained viable. Cells of both groups became necrotic when treated with an irradiance above 10.9 \texttimes 1010 W/cm2. The observed affected area of the cell layers was between 0.13 mm2 and 1.10 mm2. Since the irradiation of non-incubated cells below the mean power density of 10.9 \texttimes 1010 W/cm2 induced no necrosis, apparently no thermal damage was induced in the cells and necrosis of the 5-ALA incubated cells can be ascribed to the photodynamic effect induced by two-photon excitation. The successful photodynamic treatment of a large area of a monolayer cell culture induced by two-photon excitation offers new perspectives for photodynamic treatment modalities.},

  abstract = {The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) provides a technically and economically credible alternative concept to present day p-n junction photovoltaic devices. In contrast to the conventional systems where the semiconductor assume both the task of light absorption and charge carrier transport the two functions are separated here. Light is absorbed by a sensitizer, which is anchored to the surface of a wide band semiconductor. Charge separation takes place at the interface via photo-induced electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of the solid. Carriers are transported in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the charge collector. The use of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with oxide films of nanocrstalline morphology permits to harvest a large fraction of sunlight. Nearly quantitative conversion of incident photon into electric current is achieved over a large spectral range extending from the UV to the near IR region. Overall solar (standard AM 1.5) to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) over 10% have been reached. There are good prospects to produce these cells at lower cost than conventional devices. Here we present the current state of the field, discuss new concepts of the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cell (DSC) including heterojunction variants and analyze the perspectives for the future development of the technology.},

  abstract = {Raman scattering of two vibrational overtones of benzene is found to undergo strong preresonance enhancement as the excitation frequency approaches the 1B2u state, the lowest lying, forbidden electronic transition at 265 nm. These preresonance active modes are the first overtone of the 606 cm−1e2g fundamental, which is responsible for the vibronically induced 1B2u intensity, and the first overtone of the 848 cm−1e1g fundamental, an out-of-plane CH bending mode. In order to treat this overtone preresonance Raman behavior theoretically, the molecular polarizability is consistently expanded to second order in nuclear displacements, and thus we consider all preresonance contributions of this order. The leading contributions of strictly dipole-forbidden electronic transitions to the scattering cross-section of overtones are exposed. Within this theoretical context it is seen how scattering cross-section for each of these resonance active overtones is derived from different sources. The preresonance scattering of the 606 cm−1 overtone results from the vibronic activity of this fundamental in the 1B2u transition. On the other hand, the 848 cm−1 overtone derives its 1B2u resonance activity from the change in its fundamental frequency (to 585 cm−1) in this excited electronic state. Furthermore, the 848 cm−1 overtone activity is built upon signifficant background preresonance contributions from other higher lying electronic transitions.},

The SERS spectra of these carbocyanine dyes are dramatically different from their bulk FT-Raman and SERS spectra, but exhibit similarities to their FTIR spectra. Many SEHRS lines appear to arise from vibrational modes of the central \pi-conjugated chain, in contrast to the appearance of predominantly end-chromophore vibrations in the Raman spectra. Some of the intense surface hyper-Raman lines are found to be experimentally undetected or unresolvable by Raman scattering and IR absorption. The results thus conclusively demonstrate that, for non-centrosymmetric molecules, surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering is capable of providing important vibrational information that is unobtainable through the Raman and IR methods.},

  abstract = {The recent development of density functional theory (DFT) makes it possible to calculate accurately metalloporphyrin structures and potential surfaces. This is illustrated for nickel porphine, the vibrations of which are reliably assigned from extensive spectroscopic studies. With a minimal set of scaling factors, the DFT force field reproduces the experimental wavenumbers to higher accuracy than the best available empirical force field. Moreover, the calculated intensities are in good accord with experiment, including the surprisingly large off-resonant Raman intensities of non-totally symmetric (B1g) modes. DFT also predicts a slight ruffling distortion of the porphyrin, and accurately reproduces the IR intensity of a distortion-induced out-of-plane mode. In the case of iron porphine, DFT correctly predicts an intermediate-spin (3A2g) ground state, with short Fe-N bonds, and a high-spin (5A1g) excited state with a planar geometry but an expanded porphyrin core. When the Fe is displaced from the plane, the potential rises faster for the 3A2g than the 5A1g state, which becomes the ground state beyond a 0.4 Ang displacement. The doming mode is predicted to be at 71 cm-1, close to the 75 cm-1 wavenumber determined from coherent reaction dynamics in myoglobin. The vibrational wavenumbers of CO bound to heme are correctly calculated, and the potential for distorting the CO away from the heme normal is found to be surprisingly soft. Also, the transition dipole for the CO stretching mode is calculated to lag significantly behind the CO bond vector, thereby resolving an apparent discrepancy between crystallography and polarized IR spectroscopy with regard to the CO geometry in its adduct with myoglobin. Finally, the DFT force field was used successfully in conjunction with INDO calculations of the excited states, to reproduce resonance Raman intensities for NiP, both for Soret and Q-band resonances. These results give promise for developing a quantitative modeling capability for heme protein vibrational spectra.},

Care must be taken to recognize and avoid the signal of sp(2)-carbon contamination, the origins of which are chemical impurities and/or photophysical reactions of the chosen adsorbate. As already pointed out by KaII and co-workers, relatively large globular proteins fit only in wider gaps, and therefore the EM enhancement is several orders smaller than often reported enhancements in SM-SERS.

Highly enhancing, three-layer SERS-active substrates were constructed by evaporation of an Ag film over an Ag-clad colloidal Au submonolayer; the distinguishing feature of the three-layer substrate is the formation of evaporated Ag islands between the surface-bound colloidal particles. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the substrate morphology. The thickness of the evaporated layer was varied in order to determine the optimal substrate architecture. The estimated enhancement factor for the optimized substrate architecture was 7 x 104. Furthermore, better than 15% reproducibility in the Raman spectra for adsorbed analytes was observed from spot to spot on a given substrate, and also from substrate to substrate.

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful technique for the sensitive and selective detection of low-concentration analytes. This paper includes a discussion of the early history of SERS, the concepts that must be appreciated to optimize the intensity of SERS and the development of SERS-based sensors. In order to achieve the lowest limits of detection, both the relationship between surface nanostructure and laser excitation wavelength, as well as the analyte/surface binding chemistry, must be carefully optimized. This work exploits the highly tunable nature of nanoparticle optical properties to establish the first set of optimization conditions. The SERS enhancement factor, EFSERS, is optimized when the energy of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) lies between the energy of the excitation wavelength and the energy of the vibrational band of interest. With the narrow LSPRs used in this work, it is straightforward to achieve EFSERS similar to 10(8). These optimization conditions were exploited to develop SERS-based sensors for two important target molecules: a Bacillus anthracis biomarker and glucose in a serum protein mixture. Using these optimized film-over-nanosphere surfaces, an inexpensive, portable Raman spectrometer was used successfully to detect the infectious dose of Bacillus subtilis spores with only a 5-s data collection. The biomarker used to detect the Bacillus subtilis spores binds irreversibly to SERS substrates, whereas other important biomolecules, such as glucose, do not have any measurable binding affinity to a bare silver surface. To overcome this difficulty, a biocompatible partition layer was self-assembled on the SERS substrate before exposure to the analyte solution. Using the partition layer approach to concentrate glucose near the SERS-active substrate, physiological glucose concentrations can be detected even in the presence of interfering serum proteins.},

  abstract = {The electromagnetic theory of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), despite its simplicity, can account for all major SERS observations, including: the need for a nanostructured material as the SERS-active system, the observation that some metals form good SERS-active systems while others do not; the observation that strongly interacting metal nanoparticles result in very much more effective SERS-active systems; the observed polarization sensitivity shown by nanoparticle aggregates; and the optical behavior of nanostructured metals in the absence of a molecular adsorbate. By extending the ideas inherent in the electromagnetic model one can also understand the seminal features reported for single-molecule SERS, including the puzzling observation that only a few silver `particles' in an ensemble are `hot' (they are appropriately structured nanoparticle clusters) and that for a hot particle, once one is able to observe SERS, adding more adsorbate does not significantly alter the intensity (once the electromagnetic hot spot is occupied, adding adsorbate to other sites on the nanoparticle cluster will not add greatly to the observed intensity). However, the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned through SERS. Molecular resonances, charge-transfer transitions and other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the region where the molecule resides and then modulating electronic processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich information SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute the most interesting aspects reported by SERS. But, the overall reason why SERS produces such inordinate enhancements is largely an electromagnetic property of nanostructures.},

  abstract = {The model of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by time-dependent evolution in the intermediate anionic state of the adsorbate is analogous to intramolecular Franck-Condon resonance Raman scattering. For adsorbates with a pi* state, the residence time of some femtoseconds (10(-15) s) in the anionic state leads to a separation of electron (e) and hole (h), which quenches SERS at a smooth surface. At so-called SERS-active sites, the residence time of the hole is enhanced and therefore there is no final e-h pair and the excitation of only a molecular vibration leads to SERS. In contrast, for molecules with only high-energy sigma* states, the residence time in the anionic state is < 1 fs (analogous to the impulse mechanism in electron scattering), and the creation of e-h pairs is less likely. This leads to first-layer electronic Raman scattering, especially by C-H stretch vibrations with an average enhancement of about 30-40-fold.},

  abstract = {Pyridine as a typical model molecule has been most extensively studied by SERS for three decades. However, there has not been a satisfactory explanation for the dramatic change of the relative intensity of the two main bands assigned to the total symmetric modes at 1008 and 1035 cm-1 when pyridine was adsorbed on silver and many other metals. We performed a hybrid density functional theory study of the binding interaction and the Raman spectral properties of pyridine-metal clusters. The calculated Raman scattering factors of total symmetric modes for the pyridine-metal complexes indicate that the bonding interaction influences the relative Raman intensity of the vibrational modes. The surface bonding mechanism was analyzed on the basis of molecular orbital theory. It was also shown that the binding interaction will lead to geometric changes and result in metal-dependent surface Raman spectra. This theoretical approach could be helpful in using SERS to study surface chemistry, in particular to extract valuable information about surface bonding and adsorption through calculating and analyzing the relative intensity of SERS spectra.},

  abstract = {Metal nanoparticles-on-smooth-electrode (NOSE) was used as the substrate in a potential-dependent surface-enhanced hyper-Raman(SEHRS), hyper-Rayleigh(SEHRyS) and Raman (SERS) study of adsorbed molecules of pyridine, pyrazine and benzene. The three molecules are chosen because they are known to adsorb in different orientations on an Ag surface, thus allowing us to examine the sensitivity of SEHRS and SERS signals to the orientation of adsorbed molecules on the NOSE substrate. A computational subroutine is developed and interfaced with Gaussian-98 to calculate the numeric infrared, Raman and hyper-Raman intensities, as well as their projections along any molecular-fixed orientation axis at the level of finite perturbation theory. In this study, we tried to make four types of systematic comparisons. First, we compared the performance of Agn|Ag NOSE substrate with that of traditional substrates such as a randomly roughened Ag electrode or a randomly aggregated Ag sol in SEHRS and SERS. Secondly, we tried to compare between infrared, Raman and hyper-Raman spectra, which represent the parity-differentiated one-photon, two-photon and three-photon processes, respectively, with the aim of examining the complementarity between SEHRS and SERS as well as between SEHRS and infrared absorption. Thirdly, we compared isotropic normal spectra with surface-enhanced spectra (SEHRS and SERS), with the aim of examining the effect of surface adsorption on the selectivity and enhancement. Lastly, we made a systematic comparison between the observed and calculated spectra for both isotropic and surface spectra, which allowed us to assign and interpret the observed data and to infer the most likely orientation of the adsorbed molecules. The NOSE method can be generalized easily to other metal nanoparticles dispersed on a smooth inert metal electrode. The rapid development in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles of various sizes, shapes and crystalline states makes the NOSE method a much more flexible and versatile substrate in the study and applications of SERS and SEHRS techniques.},

  abstract = {A theoretical model is presented to describe the chemical mechanism of surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) via charge transfer (CT) in the pyridine-Ag2 complex. We first describe the influence of the interaction between the metal cluster and pyridine to the ground-state properties of the pyridine-Ag2 complex, such as charge redistribution, the change of the atomic-resolved density of state, and the change of energy levels of occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals. Second, we visualize the CT between the metal cluster and pyridine and within the intracluster on the electronic state transitions with charge difference density. The CT between the metal cluster and pyridine is the direct evidence of chemical mechanism for SERRS. Third, the spectra of SERRS are calculated with different incident light wavelengths that resonate with the different electronic state energy levels, and the enhanced intensities of different vibrational modes are compared, which show that there are different enhancement rates for different vibrational modes. Strong Raman scattering can be achieved not only by the CT between pyridine and the metal cluster but also by electronic intracluster excitation via a type of F{\"o}rster excitation transfer, and the latter results from the local field effects by collective plasmons. The selection rules for the SERRS have been obtained for these two types of enhanced mechanisms.},

Second, we investigated the quantum-size effect on the electromagnetic (EM) and chemical mechanism from 300 to 1000 nm with charge difference density. It is found that the strong absorption at around 350 nm is mainly the charge transfer (CT) excitation (CT between the molecule and the silver cluster) for large clusters, which is the direct evidence for the chemical enhancement mechanism for SERRS; for a small cluster the strong absorption around 350 nm is mainly intracluster excitation, which is the direct evidence for the EM enhancement mechanism. This conclusion is further confirmed with the general Mie theory. The plasmon peak in EM enhancement will be red-shifted with the increase of cluster size.

  abstract = {The essence of the chemical mechanism for surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) is the charge transfer (CT) between the metal and the molecule at the resonant electronic transition, which results in the mode-selective enhancement in the SERRS spectrum. The site-orientated CT can directly interpret the mode-selective chemical enhancement in SERRS. However, it is a great challenge to intutively visualize the orientation and site of the CT. In this paper, for the pyrazine-Au2 complex, a three-dimensional (3D) cubic representation is built to provide direct visual evidence for chemical mechanisms of SERRS via CT from the Au2 cluster to pyrazine at the resonant electronic transition. The relationship between the mode-selective enhancements in SERRS and the site-orientated CT was clearly revealed. The intracluster excitation (analog of plasmon excitation in large naonoparticles) was also visualized by the 3D cubic presentation, which provided the direct evidence of local electromagnetic field enhancement of SERRS. To study the quantum size effect and the coupling effect of the nanoparticles, the photoexcitation mechanisms of the Au20-pyrazine complex and the Au20-pyrazine-Au20 junction were also investigated. The tunneling charge transfer from one Au20 cluster to another Au20 cluster outside the pyrazine in Au20-pyrazine-Au20 junction was also revealed visually. The calculated normalized extinction spectra of Au nanoparticles using the generalized Mie theory reveal that the resonance peak is red-shifted due to the coupling between particles.},

A weak absorption peak at around 1060 nm for R6G-functionalized silver nanoparticles was observed, which is not present in the individual spectra of R6G or silver nanoparticles.

  abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/jrs.2651.abs Alizarin and carminic acid have been detected in reference wool and linen fibers dyed with madder and cochineal, respectively, through surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements carried out directly on the fiber, without previous hydrolysis of the mordant-dye complex. For such purpose, Ag nanoparticles were produced and immobilized in situ via the laser photoreduction of a silver nitrate aqueous solution in contact with the fiber. Control SERS spectra of pure dyes (alizarin, purpurin and carminic acid, as well as of mixtures of the first two) on similar Ag nanoparticles were also obtained. The method has been applied to one archeological Coptic textile (6th-8th A.D.) of Egyptian origin, where alizarin has been clearly identified. Other mordant dyes of the flavonoids family (luteolin, apigenin and flavonols) have also been identified by the same SERS method in wool fibers dyed with natural plants, mainly used in Central and South America (Dyer's greenweed, old fustic, onion and chilca) following pre-Columbian dying recipes.},

  abstract = {Monodisperse, citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles of sizes ranging from 15 to 40 nm were synthesized and characterized by small angle X-ray scattering and UV-vis experiments. Identical surface properties of nanoparticles of different sizes to avoid variation in the chemical surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement, as well as selection of experimental conditions so that no aggregation took place, enabled the investigation of enhancement of individual nanospheres. Enhancement factors (EFs) for SERS were determined using the dye crystal violet (CV). EFs for individual gold nanospheres ranged from 102 to 103, in agreement with theoretical predictions. An increase of the EFs of individual spheres with size can be correlated to changes in the extinction spectra of nanoparticle solutions. This confirms that the increase in enhancement with increasing size results from an increase in electromagnetic enhancement. Beyond this dependence of EFs of isolated gold spheres on their size, EFs were shown to vary with analyte concentration as a result of analyte-induced aggregation. This has implications for the application of nanoparticle solutions as SERS substrates in quantitative analytical tasks. Copyright \textcopyright 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The synthesis, film-packing properties in Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, and surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) of a new family of perylene tetracarboxylic derivatives (PTCD) are reported. The molecular organization on water subphase is extracted from surface pressure area (A) isotherms recorded under varying compression speeds and subphase temperatures. It was found that the A isotherms are temperature dependent and the area per molecule decreases with increasing temperature of the subphase. The effect is more pronounced for molecules with longer lateral chains. The isotherm for these molecules can reach high pressures, indicating strong packing on the water surface. The presence of hysteresis with and without collapsing of the film indicates the formation of aggregates on the water surface. Further, the shift to smaller areas per molecule for successive compressions shows that the aggregates are stable. The A isotherms were found to be independent of the compression speed. The area values for Langmuir films show that PTCD derivative molecules have similar arrangements on the water surface. From the extrapolated area per molecule values, it is concluded that the perylene moiety in these molecules is preferentially organized with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface. Bis(n-pentylimido)perylene (5C-PTCD), a molecule with a shorter alkyl chain, presents a lower degree of molecular packing and vertical alignment. The Langmuir monolayers were transferred onto glass substrates with a transfer ratio of 1. The UV-visible spectra using polarized light show that the packing of PTCD molecules is maintained in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The distance dependence of SEF provides indirect evidence that the molecular alignment observed in Langmuir films is also kept in LB films. It was found that the SEF enhancement factor for a bis(n-pentadecylimido)perylene (15-PTCD) monolayer on silver islands is larger than that of 5C-PTCD molecules, a finding that further supports the head-on organization in LB films.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering (SEHRS) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of centrosymmetric molecules on Ag film over nanosphere (AgFON) electrodes are presented. The SEHR spectra of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (BPE) at different potentials (vs Ag/AgCl) are presented for the first time, and a reversible potential tuning of the SEHR spectra of BPE is demonstrated. The SEHRS and SERS techniques were used to determine to what extent either site symmetry reduction or field gradient effects dictate the origin of the observed vibrational spectra. It is found that the SEHR and SER spectra for the molecules studied were distinctly different at all frequency regions at a fixed voltage, suggesting that centrosymmetry is largely retained upon adsorption to the AgFON surface and that field gradient effects are negligible. This work also shows that the SEHR spectra clearly depend on potential, whereas the SER spectra are essentially independent of potenial. It is determined that the combination of changes in $\Delta$Gads and the presence of coadsorbed counterions are responsible for altering the local symmetry of the adsorbate and only SEHRS has the sensitivity to detect these changes in the surface environment. Thus, SEHRS is a uniquely useful spectroscopic tool that is much more sensitive to the local adsorption environment than is SERS.},

Emergence of the identical band positions in the gel electrophoresis separation assures the presence of size-invariant silver nanoclusters (1.05 and 1.30 nm in core diameter) during the ligand-exchange reaction and allows us to further examine the optical/chiroptical properties of these nanoclusters. Consequently, chiral functionalization of the achiral silver nanoclusters has been demonstrated, yielding large Cotton effects in metal-based electronic transitions with an almost mirror-image relationship between the enantiomeric compounds. The ligand-exchange experiments as well as the normal syntheses of the silver nanoclusters revealed that their absorption profiles and anisotropy factors were strongly dependent on the enantiomeric purity (or enantiomeric excess) of surface chiral penicillamine, so that (several-fold) larger chiroptical responses of the silver nanoclusters as compared to those of the analogous gold clusters with a comparable size could be induced by the metal core deformation or rearrangement along with a universally influential vicinal contribution from the chiral ligand field.},

In comparison with the most widely used fiber tip for SNOM, the cantilever tip has higher optical throughput and better thermal stability, making it more suitable for detecting the extremely low Raman signal in the near-field spectroscopic investigations. Our preliminary results show that the near-field SERS with the higher spatial resolution can provide richer fingerprint information than the far-field SERS. A comparison of the two types of images shows that there are more SERS than SEF hot spots, and the two types of hot spots do not overlap. More surprisingly, the near-field SERS spectra differ from the far-field SERS spectra obtained on the same sample in the band frequency and relative intensities of some major Raman bands, and some IR-active bands were observed with the near-field mode. These results are explained mainly by the electric field gradient effect and heterogeneous polarization character that operate only in the near-field SERS.},

  abstract = {We report the time- and symmetry-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aggregates. The addition of p-aminothiophenol (p-ATP) instantly induces the aggregation of AuNPs, confirmed by large absorption in the near-IR region. Dynamic light scattering measurements show that the addition of p-ATP immediately assembles the AuNPs (13 nm) to form aggregates with a mean diameter of 200 nm, which then further grow to a size of 300 nm. Raman spectra acquired via time lapse show that the a1-symmetry bands of p-ATP are enhanced simultaneously with the formation of the aggregates, indicating that the electromagnetic enhancement largely contributes to the SERS of the AuNP aggregates. In contrast, the enhancement of the b2-symmetry bands occurs 10 h after the formation of the aggregates and slowly progresses. The enhancement of the b2 mode is attributed to the charge transfer between AuNPs and adsorbates, rather than the reorientation of the adsorbates because thiophenol and p-methylthiophenol that have surface structures and intermolecular interactions similar to those of p-ATP do not exhibit a symmetry-specific Raman enhancement pattern. To elucidate the disparity in the timescale between the charge-transfer resonance and the formation of the aggregates, we propose two models. A further close approach of the AuNPs constituting the aggregates causes the additional adsorption of the initially adsorbed p-ATP onto neighboring AuNPs, tuning the charge transfer state to be in resonance with the Raman excitation laser. Density functional theory calculations confirm the resonance charge-transfer tunneling through the bridging p-ATP in the AuNPp-ATPAuNP structures. Alternatively, the gradual continuing adsorption of p-ATP increases the local Fermi level of AuNPs into the region of resonant charge transfer from the Fermi level to the LUMO of the adsorbates. This model is corroborated by the faster appearance of b2-mode enhancement for the AuNPs with initially higher zeta potentials.},

Symmetry arguments are used to indicate that of two possible (parallel plane) alignments of donor and acceptor, that which is totally symmetric gives rise to only the lower energy CT transition whereas the unsymmetrical alignment which is energetically preferred permits the two observable CT transitions. Low molecular weight model carbazoles all show the asymmetric CT bands which have been resolved into two Gaussian components by means of a computer assisted analysis. Significantly, poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVCA) gives rise to CT bands much less asymmetric than corresponding model systems and it is concluded that steric interactions in PVCA greatly reduce the possibility for intreraction of the carbazole units with chloranil in the 1:1 asymmetric arrangement preferred by the model compounds. As expected from the theoretical argument, poly(N-ethyl-3-vinylcarbazole) and poly(N-ethyl-2-vinylcarbazole), both of which are derived from unsymmetrically substituted carbazoles, give with chloranil highly asymmetric CT spectra which are very similar to those of the appropriate model compounds.},

Thanks to new developments in instrumentation, ROA may be applied to a wide range of chiral molecular species. As well as providing the absolute configuration of small chiral molecules, the application of <i>ab initio</i> methods to the analysis of experimental ROA spectra holds great promise for the determination of the three-dimensional structure and conformational distribution in unprecedented detail. The many structure-sensitive bands in the ROA spectra of aqueous solutions of biomolecules provide detailed structural information including, in the case of proteins, the tertiary fold in addition to secondary structure elements such as helix and sheet. ROA studies of unfolded and partially folded proteins are providing new insight into the residual structure in denatured proteins and the aberrant behaviour of proteins responsible for misfolding diseases. It is even possible to measure the ROA spectra of most intact viruses, from which information about the folds of the major coat proteins and the structure of the nucleic acid core may be obtained. Hopefully this review will stimulate interest in the molecular physics aspects of the subject, and will encourage further theoretical work aimed at extracting maximum information from the plethora of structure-sensitive bands in typical ROA spectra.},

  abstract = {The interaction of light with free electrons in a gold or silver nanostructure can give rise to collective excitations commonly known as surface plasmons. Plasmons provide a powerful means of confining light to metal/dielectric interfaces, which in turn can generate intense local electromagnetic fields and significantly amplify the signal derived from analytical techniques that rely on light, such as Raman scattering. With plasmons, photonic signals can be manipulated on the nanoscale, enabling integration with electronics (which is now moving into the nano regime). However, to benefit from their interesting plasmonic properties, metal structures of controlled shape (and size) must be fabricated on the nanoscale. This issue of MRS Bulletin examines how gold and silvernanostructures can be prepared with controllable shapes to tailor their surface plasmon resonances and highlights some of the unique applications that result, including enhancement of electromagnetic fields, optical imaging, light transmission, colorimetric sensing, and nanoscale waveguiding.},

  abstract = {The scientific study of gold nanoparticles (typically 1-100 nm) has spanned more than 150 years since Faraday's time and will apparently last longer. This review will focus on a special type of ultrasmall (<2 nm) yet robust gold nanoparticles that are protected by thiolates, so-called gold thiolate nanoclusters, denoted as Au(SR) (where, n and m represent the number of gold atoms and thiolate ligands, respectively). Despite the past fifteen years' intense work on Au(SR) nanoclusters, there is still a tremendous amount of science that is not yet understood, which is mainly hampered by the unavailability of atomically precise Au(SR) clusters and by their unknown structures. Nonetheless, recent research advances have opened an avenue to achieving the precise control of Au(SR) nanoclusters at the ultimate atomic level. The successful structural determination of Au102(SPhCOOH)44 and [Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)18] (q = -1, 0) by X-ray crystallography has shed some light on the unique atomic packing structure adopted in these gold thiolate nanoclusters, and has also permitted a precise correlation of their structure with properties, including electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Some exciting research is anticipated to take place in the next few years and may stimulate a long-lasting and wider scientific and technological interest in this special type of Au nanoparticles.},

Data obtained using a newly developed repetitive break junction method are interpreted in terms of single-molecule resistances of 526 +- 90 MO in the open form and 4 +- 1 MO in the closed form when the molecule is bound between two gold contacts via dithiol linkages. The corresponding ratio of open to closed resistance is in close agreement with the results of ab initio calculations, though the measured resistances are about half of the calculated values. Optical spectroscopy indicates that the photoisomerization occurs in both directions on small gold particles, evaporated thin gold films, and in the break junction experiments. http://stacks.iop.org/0957-4484/16/695},

The model is based on the representation of atoms by an induced electric charge and a dipole moment. The extension of the charge-dipole model to the interaction with oscillating electric fields requires us to account for the kinetics of the free moving charges and of the atomic dipoles. This step is achieved by first relating the oscillations of the atomic charges to the currents that flow through the atomic bonds. Adopting a classical description of this system of charges and dipoles, the time evolution of these quantities is determined from the principle that the action be minimized. As an application of this model, we compute the frequency-dependent molecular polarizability of hydrocarbons with different hybridization. We propose parameters for each chemical group, which provide an excellent agreement with reference data provided by current-density-functional theory. We finally study the frequency-dependent molecular polarizability of fullerenes ranging from C60 to C1500.},

We find that nanowire arrays act as frameworks for effective SERS substrates with a significantly higher Raman signal sensitivity than a planar framework of Au nanoparticles adsorbed two-dimensionally on a flat surface. The SERS signal displays a clear polarization-dependent effect when the nanowires are arranged in a row. We also find that the SERS signal increases with time during continuous laser illumination. The plasmon-enhanced optical forces between Au nanoparticles may either move pairs of nanoparticles closer together or attract adsorbed molecules by moving them to the junctions of Au nanoparticle aggregates. Such effects by plasmon optical forces may cause the observed increase of the SERS signal with continuous laser illumination.},

  abstract = {We present a charge-dipole interaction model for the calculation of the frequency-dependent polarizability of silver clusters. The model relies on the representation of silver atoms by both a net electric charge and a dipole. Time variations of the atomic charges are related to the currents that flow through the bonds of the structures considered and the atomic charges and dipoles are eventually determined from the application of a least-action principle. After a generalization that enables the bonds of the bulk and surface atoms to have specific resistances, the model is parameterized on data obtained by the time-dependent density functional theory for tetrahedral Ag20, Ag84 and Ag120 clusters. We then study the polarization properties of dimers of silver clusters. We compare in particular the polarizability of the dimers with that of the isolated clusters, for a range of gap distances and frequencies. We also consider the field enhancements one can achieve with these systems. The results are in good agreement with reference data and enable an extension of these data to a wider range of situations. They show that significant field enhancements are achieved at frequencies associated with resonant polarization along the axis of the dimer.},

Association through hydrogen bonding among the biomolecules is considered to be essential for CD signal generation, which was confirmed by experiment with cysteine methyl ester.

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

  abstract = {Electronic interactions at the nanoscale represent one of the fundamental problems of nanotechnology. Excitons and plasmons are the two most typical excited states of nanostructures, which have been shown to produce coupled electronic systems. Here, we explore these interactions for the case of nanowires with mobile excitons and nanoparticles with localized plasmons and describe the theoretical formalism, its experimental validation and the potential practical applications of such nanoscale systems. Theory predicts that emission of coupled excitations in nanowires with variable electronic confinement is stronger, shorter and blue-shifted. These predictions were confirmed with a high degree of accuracy in molecular spring assemblies of CdTe nanowires and Au nanoparticles, where we can reversibly change the distance between the exciton and the plasmon. The prepared systems were made protein-sensitive by incorporating antibodies in the molecular springs. Modulation of exciton-plasmon interactions can serve as a wavelength-based biodetection tool, which can resolve difficulties in the quantification of luminescence intensity for complex media and optical pathways},

For an economical use of water and solar energy, catalysts that are sufficiently efficient, stable, inexpensive and capable of harvesting light are required.

Contrary to other conducting polymer semiconductors, carbon nitride is chemically and thermally stable and does not rely on complicated device manufacturing. The results represent an important first step towards photosynthesis in general where artificial conjugated polymer semiconductors can be used as energy transducers.},

Azobenzene, a molecule that changes conformation as a result of a trans/cis transition when exposed to radiation, could form the basis of a light-driven molecular switch12, 13, 14. It is therefore crucial to clarify the electrical transport characteristics of this molecule. Here, we investigate, theoretically, charge transport in a system in which a single azobenzene molecule is attached to two carbon nanotubes. In clear contrast to gold electrodes, the nanotubes can act as true nanoscale electrodes and we show that the low-energy conduction properties of the junction may be dramatically modified by changing the topology of the contacts between the nanotubes and the molecules, and/or the chirality of the nanotubes (that is, zigzag or armchair). We propose experiments to demonstrate controlled electrical switching with nanotube electrodes.},

  abstract = {Enhanced Raman scattering from metal surfaces has been investigated for over 30 years. Silver surfaces are known to produce a large effect, and this can be maximized by producing a roughened surface, which can be achieved by the aggregation of silver nanoparticles. However, an approach to control this aggregation, in particular through the interaction of biological molecules such as DNA, has not been reported. Here we show the selective turning on of the surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering5 effect on dye-coded, DNA-functionalized, silver nanoparticles through a target-dependent, sequence-specific DNA hybridization assembly that exploits the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism for the scattering. Dye-coded nanoparticles that do not undergo hybridization experience no enhancement and hence do not give surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering. This is due to the massive difference in enhancement from nanoparticle assemblies compared with individual nanoparticles. The electromagnetic enhancement is the dominant effect and, coupled with an understanding of the surface chemistry, allows surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering nanosensors to be designed based on a natural biological recognition process.},

It accordingly becomes necessary to test whether this is actually the case. The experiments we have made have confirmed this anticipation, and shown that in every case in which light is scattered by the molecules in dust-free liquids or gases, the diffuse radiation of the ordinary kind, having the same wave-length as the incident beam, is accompanied by a modified scattered radiation of degraded frequency.},

Here we describe a photovoltaic cell, created from low-to medium-purity materials through low-cost processes, which exhibits a commercially realistic energy-conversion efficiency. The device is based on a 10-microm-thick, optically transparent film of titanium dioxide particles a few nanometres in size, coated with a monolayer of a charge-transfer dye to sensitize the film for light harvesting. Because of the high surface area of the semiconductor film and the ideal spectral characteristics of the dye, the device harvests a high proportion of the incident solar energy flux (46%) and shows exceptionally high efficiencies for the conversion of incident photons to electrical current (more than 80%). The overall light-to-electric energy conversion yield is 7.1-7.9% in simulated solar light and 12% in diffuse daylight. The large current densities (greater than 12 mA cm-2) and exceptional stability (sustaining at least five million turnovers without decomposition), as well as the low cost, make practical applications feasible.},

  abstract = {Important Ca2+ signals in the cytosol and organelles are often extremely localized and hard to measure. To overcome this problem we have constructed new fluorescent indicators for Ca2+ that are genetically encoded without cofactors and are targetable to specific intracellular locations. We have dubbed these fluorescent indicators 'cameleons'. They consist of tandem fusions of a blue- or cyan-emitting mutant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)1,2, calmodulin3, 4, 5, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13 (ref. 6), and an enhanced green- or yellow-emitting GFP7, 8, 9. Binding of Ca2+ makes calmodulin wrap around the M13 domain, increasing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the flanking GFPs2. Calmodulin mutations can tune the Ca2+ affinities to measure free Ca2+ concentrations in the range 10-8 to 10-2 M. We have visualized free Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum of single HeLa cells transfected with complementary DNAs encoding chimaeras bearing appropriate localization signals. Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum of individual cells ranged from 60 to 400 microM at rest, and 1 to 50 microM after Ca2+ mobilization. FRET is also an indicator of the reversible intermolecular association of cyan-GFP-labelled calmodulin with yellow-GFP-labelled M13. Thus FRET between GFP mutants can monitor localized Ca2+ signals and protein heterodimerization in individual live cells.},

  abstract = {The modification and control of exciton-photon interactions in semiconductors is of both fundamental and practical interest, being of direct relevance to the design of improved light-emitting diodes, photodetectors and lasers. In a semiconductor microcavity, the confined electromagnetic field modifies the optical transitions of the material. Two distinct types of interaction are possible: weak and strong coupling. In the former perturbative regime, the spectral and spatial distribution of the emission is modified but exciton dynamics are little altered. In the latter case, however, mixing of exciton and photon states occurs leading to strongly modified dynamics. Both types of effect have been observed in planar microcavity structures in inorganic semiconductor quantum wells and bulk layers. But organic semiconductor microcavities have been studied only in the weak-coupling regime. Here we report an organic semiconductor microcavity that operates in the strong-coupling regime. We see characteristic mixing of the exciton and photon modes (anti-crossing), and a room-temperature vacuum Rabi splitting (an indicator of interaction strength) that is an order of magnitude larger than the previously reported highest values for inorganic semiconductors. Our results may lead to new structures and device concepts incorporating hybrid states of organic and inorganic excitons, and suggest that polariton lasing may be possible.},

  abstract = {We have surveyed proteins with known atomic structure whose function involves electron transfer; in these, electrons can travel up to 14 \r A between redox centres through the protein medium. Transfer over longer distances always involves a chain of cofactors. This redox centre proximity alone is sufficient to allow tunnelling of electrons at rates far faster than the substrate redox reactions it supports. Consequently, there has been no necessity for proteins to evolve optimized routes between redox centres. Instead, simple geometry enables rapid tunnelling to high-energy intermediate states. This greatly simplifies any analysis of redox protein mechanisms and challenges the need to postulate mechanisms of superexchange through redox centres or the maintenance of charge neutrality when investigating electron-transfer reactions. Such tunnelling also allows sequential electron transfer in catalytic sites to surmount radical transition states without involving the movement of hydride ions, as is generally assumed. The 14 \r A or less spacing of redox centres provides highly robust engineering for electron transfer, and may reflect selection against designs that have proved more vulnerable to mutations during the course of evolution.},

  abstract = {Small molecules such as NO, O2, CO or H2 are important biological ligands that bind to metalloproteins to function crucially in processes such as signal transduction, respiration and catalysis. A key issue for understanding the regulation of reaction mechanisms in these systems is whether ligands gain access to the binding sites through specific channels and docking sites, or by random diffusion through the protein matrix. A model system for studying this issue is myoglobin, a simple haem protein. Myoglobin has been studied extensively by spectroscopy, crystallography, computation and theory. It serves as an aid to oxygen diffusion but also binds carbon monoxide, a byproduct of endogenous haem catabolism. Molecular dynamics simulations, random mutagenesis6 and flash photolysis studies indicate that ligand migration occurs through a limited number of pathways involving docking sites.

  abstract = {The increasing demand of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries for enantiomerically pure compounds has spurred the development of a range of so-called 'chiral technologies' (ref. 1), which aim to exert the ultimate control over a chemical reaction by directing its enantioselectivity2. Heterogeneous enantioselective catalysis3, 4, 5 is particularly attractive because it allows the production and ready separation of large quantities of chiral product while using only small quantities of catalyst. Heterogeneous enantioselectivity is usually induced by adsorbing chiral molecules onto catalytically active surfaces1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. A mimic of one such catalyst is formed by adsorbing (R,R)-tartaric acid molecules on Cu(110) surfaces: this generates a variety of surface phases, of which only one is potentially catalytically active8, and leaves the question of how adsorbed chiral molecules give rise to enantioselectivity. Here we show that the active phase consists of extended supramolecular assemblies of adsorbed (R,R)-tartaric acid, which destroy existing symmetry elements of the underlying metal and directly bestow chirality to the modified surface. The adsorbed assemblies create chiral 'channels' exposing bare metal atoms, and it is these chiral spaces that we believe to be responsible for imparting enantioselectivity, by forcing the orientation of reactant molecules docking onto catalytically active metal sites. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to sustain a single chiral domain across an extended surface-provided that reflection domains of opposite handedness are removed by a rigid and chiral local adsorption geometry, and that inequivalent rotation domains are removed by successful matching of the rotational symmetry of the adsorbed molecule with that of the underlying metal surface.},

  abstract = {Multiplexed optical recording provides an unparalleled approach to increasing the information density beyond 10^12 bits per cm^3 (1 Tbit cm-3) by storing multiple, individually addressable patterns within the same recording volume. Although wavelength, polarization and spatial dimensions have all been exploited for multiplexing, these approaches have never been integrated into a single technique that could ultimately increase the information capacity by orders of magnitude. The major hurdle is the lack of a suitable recording medium that is extremely selective in the domains of wavelength and polarization and in the three spatial domains, so as to provide orthogonality in all five dimensions. Here we show true five-dimensional optical recording by exploiting the unique properties of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of gold nanorods. The longitudinal SPR exhibits an excellent wavelength and polarization sensitivity, whereas the distinct energy threshold required for the photothermal recording mechanism provides the axial selectivity. The recordings were detected using longitudinal SPR-mediated two-photon luminescence, which we demonstrate to possess an enhanced wavelength and angular selectivity compared to conventional linear detection mechanisms. Combined with the high cross-section of two-photon luminescence, this enabled non-destructive, crosstalk-free readout. This technique can be immediately applied to optical patterning, encryption and data storage, where higher data densities are pursued.},

Fluorescence from dye molecules dispersed in a thin polymer film that covered the dimers was used to probe the interaction between fluorophores and the nano-antennae. Through a suitable choice of dye emission spectrum and spectral position of the dimer resonance, we were able to focus on the way the plasmon resonances may mediate absorption of incident light by the dye.

  abstract = {Tetracene (Tc) and rubrene (Rub) are two prototype fluorescent molecules. Both molecules exhibit the same 'fluorescent backbone', but due to the additional phenyl groups, the backbone of Rub is twisted, whereas it is planar for Tc. In agreement with earlier investigations, optical spectroscopy of the respective solutions reveals that the S0-S1 transition in Rub is red-shifted with respect to Tc by $\sim$2000 cm-1 and that Rub exhibits a considerably larger Stokes shift. In order to unravel the physical origin of these differences, we have performed a detailed normal coordinate analysis and frequency calculations using density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with linear response time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) energy scan calculations. The calculations yield dimensionless normal coordinate displacements of the excited-state origin that were employed for the calculation of the vibrational finestructure of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of Tc and Rub. The purely theoretical displacements were subsequently refined through fitting to the experimental spectra using the time-dependent theory of electronic spectroscopy. The analysis reveals that the $\sim$2000 cm-1 red shift of the 0-0 vibronic band of Rub relative to Tc is mainly caused by the inductive effect of the phenyl substituents that leads to destabilization of the donor molecular orbital (MO) (the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)). The large Stokes shift of 820 cm-1 observed for Rub is found to originate mainly from unresolved vibrational progressions involving low-frequency modes that are characterized by appreciable displacements in the excited state. The analysis shows that the spectra of Rub are strongly subject to temperature induced broadening, whereas for Tc this is much less significant.},

For Ag nanoparticles, coherent exciton coupling to the conduction band electrons leads to constructive interference and a long-lived exciton. For Au nanoparticles, the excitonic state interferes destructively with bound electron transition dipoles and the exciton lifetime is reduced by two orders of magnitude. Coherent polarization coupling in heterostructured nanomaterials may strongly impact the functionality of future nanoelectronic and nanooptical materials.},

Surprisingly, the chemical enhancement is found to account for as much as 105, suggesting that this mechanism might be more important than previously believed, in particular for nanoparticle aggregates. Moreover, TDDFT calculations suggest that unlike larger nanoparticles, the junction between small Ag20 tetrahedral clusters does not provide an electromagnetic "hot spot".},

Here we report on the observation of strong coupling between a plasmon supported by an assembly of oriented gold nanorods (ANR) and a molecular exciton.

The previously observed decrease in the lifetime was studied as a function of the tilt angle between the long axis of the nanorod and the electric field polarization direction of the plasmon inducing exciting light. It is observed that the strongest enhancement to the exciton relaxation rate occurs when the two axes are parallel to one another.

  abstract = {Control of the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles (NP) is realized using an electrochemical switch consisting of a thin layer of conducting polymer (CP). It is shown that the quenching of localized surface plasmon (LSP) sustained by oblate particles depends of the frequency of the LSP resonance. This effect is attributed to the variation of the CP dielectric function with wavelength. As a consequence, prolate arrays show total quenching of the LSP resonance along the major axis of the particles whereas modulation and moderate damping are observed along the minor axis. Combining electroactive conducting polymer and prolate NP makes it possible to design active plasmonic devices with anisotropic optical response upon CP switching. In the present case, such devices can be used as active filters or polarizers},

  abstract = {We report on the strong polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence on single gold nanorods. The fluorescence from the organic fluorophores that are embedded in a mesostructured silica shell around individual gold nanorods is enhanced by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the nanorods. Our electrostatic calculations show that under an off-resonance excitation, the electric field intensity contour around a nanorod rotates away from the length axis as the excitation polarization is varied. The polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence is ascribed to the dependence of the averaged electric field intensity enhancement within the silica shell on the excitation polarization. The measured fluorescence enhancement factor is in very good agreement with that obtained from the electrostatic calculations. The fluorescence enhancement factor increases as the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is synthetically tuned close to the excitation wavelength. In addition, the polarization dependence is used to determine the orientation angle of the gold nanorods. The results are in excellent agreement with the actual measurements. Furthermore, the emission spectrum of the fluorophore is modified by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the gold nanorods. A linear correlation between the emission peak wavelength and the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is obtained.},

  abstract = {Strong plasmonic--molecular resonance coupling occurs between noble metal nanocrystals and organic adsorbates when the plasmonic resonance is degenerate with the molecular one. This interaction forms the basis for many fundamental studies and practical applications. We describe here the first direct measurement of the resonance coupling on single gold nanorods. The dark-field scattering technique is employed. The nanorods are embedded in hydrogel to facilitate uniform dye adsorption. The adsorbed dye molecules exhibit both monomer and H-aggregate absorption bands. The same gold nanorods are measured before and after the dye adsorption. Both strong and weak coupling are investigated by selecting nanorods with different longitudinal plasmon bands. Excellent agreement between the experiments and an analytic theory is obtained. The resonance coupling reveals a unique three-band structure. The tunability of the coupling on individual nanorods is further demonstrated by photodecomposing the adsorbed dye molecules.},

  abstract = {Graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms packed into a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb crystal structure, which is a special material with many excellent properties. In the present study, we will discuss the possibility that graphene can be used as a substrate for enhancing Raman signals of adsorbed molecules. Here, phthalocyanine (Pc), rhodamine 6G (R6G), protoporphyin IX (PPP), and crystal violet (CV), which are popular molecules widely used as a Raman probe, are deposited equally on graphene and a SiO2/Si substrate using vacuum evaporation or solution soaking. By comparing the Raman signals of molecules on monolayer graphene and on a SiO2/Si substrate, we observed that the intensities of the Raman signals on monolayer graphene are much stronger than on a SiO2/Si substrate, indicating a clear Raman enhancement effect on the surface of monolayer graphene. For solution soaking, the Raman signals of the molecules are visible even though the concentration is low to 108 mol/L or less. What's more interesting, the enhanced efficiencies are quite different on monolayer, few-layer, multilayer graphene, graphite, and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The Raman signals of molecules on multilayer graphene are even weaker than on a SiO2/Si substrate, and the signals are even invisible on graphite and HOPG. Taking the Raman signals on the SiO2/Si substrate as a reference, Raman enhancement factors on the surface of monolayer graphene can be obtained using Raman intensity ratios. The Raman enhancement factors are quite different for different peaks, changing from 2 to 17. Furthermore, we found that the Raman enhancement factors can be distinguished through three classes that correspond to the symmetry of vibrations of the molecule. We attribute this enhancement to the charge transfer between graphene and the molecules, which result in a chemical enhancement. This is a new phenomenon for graphene that will expand the application of graphene to microanalysis and is good for studying the basic properties of both graphene and SERS.},

  abstract = {We present the first super-resolution optical images of single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SM-SERS) hot spots, using super-resolution imaging as a powerful new tool for understanding the interaction between single molecules and nanoparticle hot spots. Using point spread function fitting, we map the centroid position of SM-SERS with 10 nm resolution, revealing a spatial relationship between the SM-SERS centroid position and the highest SERS intensity. We are also able to measure the unique position of the SM-SERS centroid relative to the centroid associated with nanoparticle photoluminescence, which allows us to speculate on the presence of multiple hot spots within a single diffraction-limited spot. These measurements allow us to follow dynamic movement of the SM-SERS centroid position over time as it samples different locations in space and explores regions larger than the expected size of a SM-SERS hot spot. We have proposed that the movement of the SERS centroid is due to diffusion of a single molecule on the surface of the nanoparticle, which leads to changes in coupling between the scattering dipole and the optical near field of the nanoparticle.},

Despite the mild electromagnetic field enhancement (105) and high surface density of the ABT-molecules (240 molecules/hotspot) at the junctions, we observed the clear spectral and temporal signatures of CT-enhanced single-molecule SERS (SM-SERS). The result reveals that only a small fraction of the molecules at the junction has a significant CT-enhancement of 101103, whereas the rest of the molecules are nearly CT-inactive. Furthermore, the result also proves that overall (charge-transfer and electromagnetic) enhancement of 106-108 is sufficient to observe the SM-SERS of an electronically off-resonant molecule, which disproves the widespread belief that a minimum enhancement of 1014 is required for SM-SERS.},

A preconditioned iterative solution method is presented when R and S are symmetric positive semi-definite and at least one of R, S is positive definite.

Ru-L gave strong emissions at [similar]660 and [similar]733 nm through linear or two-photon excitation.

Cell-based studies of these complex conjugates were conducted using human nasopharyngeal carcinoma HK-1 and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells on which Ru-L showed rapid cellular uptake, low dark-cytotoxicity, and high photo-cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Ru-L can be excited and emits in the "biological window" in vitro, making it a potential potent new generation photodynamic therapeutic agent capable of singlet oxygen generation and in vitro near-infrared emission.},

A representative series of C5-substituted thienyl hexahydro- and hexafluoro-cyclopentene based photochromes was investigated to explore the effect and potential usefulness of substitution for the development of multicomponent memory materials. The effect of the deposition method on the photochemistry of solid materials containing photochromic dithienylcyclopentene switches was also explored. Photoconversion in the solid state to the closed form was found to be low when starting from the open form, but, in contrast, ring opening to the open state from the closed form was found to be complete. The effect was found to be due to inner filter rather than conformational phenomena. Characteristic vibrational bands for the central dithienyl core are assigned and a comparison made of the vibrational spectroscopic properties of the perhydro- and perfluoro switches. The data enable the determination of the photoconversion achievable in the solid state as well as some assessment of the influence of the deposition method on the photoconversion. The potential of Raman spectroscopy as a method of achieving non-destructive optical readout is demonstrated through the large differences in absolute Raman scattering intensity between the open and closed states, when monitored at wavelengths which do not result in photochemical ring opening.},

  abstract = {The response of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near and beyond the limit where the particles are touching. As the particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle coupling and that is associated with a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes singular as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling across the interparticle gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited. Lowerwavelength, higher-order modes show a similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through the emergence of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction is made by contact between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution is continuous through contact. The calculated singular response explains recent experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design of nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits.},

Using this structure in our simulations, the lateral confinement of propagating designer surface plasmons is demonstrated. Focusing, collimation and waveguiding of designer plasmons in the lateral direction is realized by changing the width of the source beam.

All structures have been optimized in C(s) symmetry. The resulting geometries are rationalized in terms of orbital interactions. The metal-ligand bond energy has been determined for all systems in calculations where nonlocal corrections were added to the LDA energy expression. It was possible to break down the total metal-ligand bond energy into contributions stemming from sigma-donation and pi-back-bonding; hence, it is possible to rank thioethers and selenoethers in terms of a-donor and pi-acceptor ability. In general, thio- and selenoethers are rather poor pi-acceptors and weak sigma-donors. The methyl-substituted chalcogenoethers are better sigma-donors than the chalcogenhydrides. It is found that the fluoro-substituted chalcogen systems exhibit good pi-acceptor abilities, comparable to those found for PF3. Surprisingly, the fluorine substitution does not significantly decrease the sigma-donor ability. The Cr-E bond energies increase in the order Cr-EH2 < Cr-EMe2 < Cr-EF2 (E = O, S, Se).},

The second-order NLO response was assessed by the EFISH technique (\beta_{vec}), working with a nonresonant incident wavelength of 1.907 \mu m and by solvatochromic studies (\beta_{CT}). These results are compared with the behavior of mononuclear [W(CO)5L] complexes (L = pyridine or trans-stilbazole para substituted with acceptor groups) and of classical structurally related organic push−pull aromatic chromophores. The second-order NLO response of asymmetric chromophores with BPE as linker is comparable, with the exception of the sign, to classical push−pull stilbenic compounds. However when pyrazine is the linker, the response can be higher (BF3 as acceptor group) or higher but with opposite sign (``cis-Rh(CO)2Cl'' as acceptor group) than the related push−pull benzenic chromophores. Only with a pyrazine linker and ``cis-Re(CO)4Cl'' as acceptor does the second-order NLO response becomes irrelevant. The above results are interpreted assuming that the MLCT (W \textrightarrow \pi*L) transition, originating from the ``W(CO)5'' moiety, dominates the second-order response of these push−pull heteronuclear dimeric chromophores.},

Here we report that time-dependent density functional theory with the B3LYP functional and an appropriate basis set can give reliable absorption spectra for carbon- and oxygen-centered radicals derived from curcumin, which indicates the potential of theoretical methods in helping assign transient spectra. },

  abstract = {Among a number of candidates, photons have advantages for implementing qubits: very weak coupling to the environment, the existing single photon measurement technique, and so on. Moreover, commercially available fiber-optic devices enable us to construct quantum circuits that consist of one-qubit operations (including classically controlled gates). Fiber optics resolves the mode matching problems in conventional optics and provides mechanically stable optical circuits. A quantum Fourier transform (QFT) followed by measurement was demonstrated with a simple circuit based on fiber optics. The circuit was shown to be robust against imperfections in the rotation gate. The error probability was estimated to be 0.01 per qubit, which corresponded to error-free operation for 100 qubits. The error probability can be further reduced to achieve successful QFT of 1024 qubits by taking the majority of the accumulated results. As is well known, QFT is a key function in quantum computations such as the final part of Shor's factorization algorithm. The present QFT circuit, in combination with controlled unitary gates, would make possible practical quantum computers. Possible schemes of realizing quantum computers in this line are explored.},

  abstract = {Potential-energy profiles along the minimum-energy reaction path for intramolecular proton transfer in the [small pi][small pi]* excited state have been calculated for the title compounds. The CASSCF and CIS electronic-structure methods have been employed for excited-state geometry optimization. Single-point energy calculations along the reaction path have been performed using the CASPT2 and TDDFT methods. The TDDFT method has been tested against accurate CASSCF and CASPT2 data for malonaldehyde. CASPT2 yields transition energies for photon absorption and emission which are in excellent agreement with experimental data (within 0.2 eV). The CASPT2 potential energy functions exhibit, however, artifactual kinks (on a scale of a single kcal mol) which reflect inherent limitations of the CASSCF-based perturbation approach. TDDFT yields potential-energy functions which are essentially parallel to the CASPT2 functions and free of artifacts. Transition energies for absorption and emission are systematically overestimated, however, by about 0.5 eV in TDDFT. For all three title compounds, a barrierless [small pi][small pi]* potential-energy function is predicted. The location of the [small pi][small pi]* minimum varies from near-enol in salicylic acid to near-keto in 7-hydroxy-1-indanone.},

We optimize the most important geometries with CASSCF and we calculate the potential energy curves for the lowest states (4 singlets and 2 triplets) with multireference perturbation theory.

Some of these problems are presented in the introductory part to justify a strategy to elaborate a theoretical model starting from an accurate continuum description of the solvent. This is here achieved through the polarizable continuum model (PCM), which also permits explicit consideration of solvent molecules. The decision of relying on the description of a large number of properties to refine the model is then justified. The consideration of complex molecular properties of a various nature has led to the elaboration of numerous additional features not present in the basic version of PCM, some among which are here briefly presented: local field and nonequilibrium effects, specific solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions, description of condensed phase with more complex structure. The paper ends with the presentation of some results, selected among a larger set of available examples, and limited to a few properties, to show the potentialities of the approach.},

The Raman spectra were computed numerically in the standard Placzek approximation with the additional feature of a static external electric field, F, perturbation to the system Hamiltonian. F was allowed to change the system equilibrium geometry and symmetry as well as the polarisability, resulting in shifted vibration frequencies and changed Raman intensities. All calculations were done on a Hartree-Fock (HF) level using the 6-31+G* or the Sadlej p-VTZ basis sets for Pyr, and the Stevens-Krauss (SBKJC) VDZ ECP basis set for Ag. Raman enhancement factors over 5 orders of magnitude were obtained. The enhancement was analyzed as being due to polarization and charge transfer induced by the metal-molecule contact in the absence of F and in the presence of a strong F as due to increased polarisability derivatives along the surface normal. The use of the present method to qualitatively and quantitatively predict surface Raman spectra is discussed.},

  abstract = {The interactions between luminophore [Ru(bpy)], and the lacunary Dawson heteropolyanions, [PWO(FeOH)], [PWO(FeBr)] and [PWO] were investigated using a combination of photophysics, optical and Raman spectroscopy. Extensive quenching of the excited state of [Ru(bpy)] was observed in each case. Quenching is attributed to the formation of association complexes between [Ru(bpy)] and the heteropolyanions in which the charge on the heteropolyanions is fully compensated for by the ruthenium polypyridyl species. The interaction appears to be principally electrostatic in nature producing [Ru(bpy)][PWO(FeOH)], [Ru(bpy)][PWO(FeBr)] and [Ru(bpy)][PWO]. The association constants for formation of the clusters were obtained from photophysical studies and surprisingly, despite the electrostatic nature of the interaction, there was no correlation between the charge on the polyoxometallate and the association constant. In particular, the unsubstituted lacunary, [PWO], showed considerably weaker association compared to the transition metal substituted lacunaries, in spite of its 10 charge. Difference absorption spectroscopy revealed a new transition at . 480 nm for each of the cluster complexes. From resonance Raman spectroscopy the origin of this transition was found to involve the polyoxometallate. Unlike previously reported adducts, the cluster complexes formed were not luminescent. In all cases the cluster complexes exhibit remarkable photostability, with no photodecomposition or photo-induced ligand exchange reactions evident in acetonitrile, under conditions where [Ru(bpy)] alone exhibits considerable photolability.},

Phys. Chem. B, 2000, 104, 2630-2641), could arise from symmetric metal cores perturbed by a dissymmetric or chiral field originating from the adsorbates. This finding implies that the electronic states of the nanocluster core are chiral, yet the lattice geometries of these cores need not be geometrically distorted by the chiral adsorbates. Based on simple chiral monolayer protected cluster models, we rationalize how the adsorption pattern of the tethering sulfur atoms has a substantial effect on the induced CD in the NIR spectral region, and we show how the chiral image charge produced in the core provides a convenient means of visualizing dissymmetric perturbations to the achiral gold nanocluster core.},

Lett., 2005, 94, 043002). The central quantities are a splitting functional \gamma[n] and a complementary exchange-correlation functional E^{\gamma}_{XC}[n]. We give a practical method for determining the value of \gamma in molecules, assuming an approximation for E^{\gamma}_{XC} is given. The resulting theory shows good ability to reproduce the ionization potentials for various molecules. However it is not of sufficient accuracy for forming a satisfactory framework for studying molecular properties. A somewhat different approach is then adopted, which depends on a density-independent \gamma and an additional parameter w eliminating part of the local exchange functional. The values of these two parameters are obtained by best-fitting to experimental atomization energies and bond lengths of the molecules in the G2(1) database. The optimized values are \gamma = 0.5 a-10 and w = 0.1. We then examine the performance of this slightly semi-empirical functional for a variety of molecular properties, comparing to related works and experiment. We show that this approach can be used for describing in a satisfactory manner a broad range of molecular properties, be they static or dynamic. Most satisfactory is the ability to describe valence, Rydberg and inter-molecular charge-transfer excitations.},

The azobenzene unit is connected to the surface by a tripodal linker system with an adamantane core, which results in both a sufficient decoupling of the functional azobenzene unit from the metallic substrate and a free volume to prevent steric hindrance, thus allowing the isomerization process. Optical excitation at 405 nm induces the trans [rightward arrow] cis isomerization, whereas light exposure at 470 nm leads to the back reaction. The effective cross sections for the reactions are [sigma]eff(cis) = 4 +/- 1 [times] 10-18 cm2 at 405 nm (trans [rightward arrow] cis) and [sigma]eff(trans) = 2.5 +/- 0.9 [times] 10-19 cm2 at 470 nm (cis [rightward arrow] trans).

The enhancement mechanism (CHEM) due to the molecule-surface chemical coupling in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been characterized for this system. We demonstrate that it is possible to control the CHEM enhancement by switching the photoswitch from its closed form to its open form. The open form of the photoswitch is found to be the strongest Raman scatterer when adsorbed on the surface whereas the opposite is found for the free molecule. This trend is explained using a simple two-state approximation. In this model the CHEM enhancement scales roughly as $(\omega_X/\bar{\omega}_e)^4$, where $\omega_X$ is the HOMO--LUMO gap of the free molecule and $\bar{\omega}_e$ is an average excitation between the HOMO of the photoswitch and the LUMO of the metal. We propose that the ability of this photoswitch to reversibly switch from open to closed will make it an excellent probe to control the CHEM enhancement of SERS.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of chemical bonding on Raman scattering from benzenethiol chemisorbed on silver clusters using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Raman scattering cross sections are computed using a formalism that employs analytical derivatives of frequency-dependent electronic polarizabilities, which treats both off-resonant and resonant enhancement within the same scheme. In the off-resonant regime, Raman scattering into molecular vibrational modes is enhanced by one order of magnitude and shows pronounced dependence on the orientation and the local symmetry of the molecule. Additional strong enhancement of the order of 102 arises from resonant transitions to mixed metal-molecular electronic states. The Raman enhancement is analyzed using Raman excitation profiles (REPs) for the range of excitation energies 1.6-3.0 eV, in which isolated benzenethiol does not have electronic transitions. The computed vibrational frequency shifts and relative Raman scattering cross sections of the metal-molecular complexes are in good agreement with experimental data on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from benzenethiol adsorbed on silver surfaces. Characterization and understanding of these effects, associated with chemical enhancement mechanism, may be used to improve the detection sensitivity in molecular Raman scattering.},

  abstract = {SERS spectra of 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) on iron smooth surface doped with silver nanoparticles have been recorded and compared with those previously obtained on Ag doped smooth silver, copper and nickel surfaces. In order to correctly assign the SERS spectra, DFT/B3LYP calculations of phen and different models of phen/metal surface complexes have been performed. The 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was used for phen, whereas a mixed basis 6-311++G(d,p)/LANL2DZ was utilized in the case of the phen/metal complexes. From the comparison between the experimental and computational data, it was evidenced that phen was chemisorbed through its N atoms to the Ag, Cu, Ni and Fe surfaces, whereas the deposited Ag colloidal nanoparticles only played the role of providing the electromagnetic enhancement (with a factor of more than 103) necessary to detect a suitable SERS signal.},

  abstract = {The dimethylamino nitro stilbene (DANS) molecule is studied for exploring solvent effects on two-photon absorption using the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) response theory approach, where the quantum part is represented by density functional theory. We have explored the role of geometrical change of the chromophore in solution, the importance of taking a dynamical average over the sampled structures and the role of a granular representation of the polarization and electrostatic interactions with the classically described medium. The line shape function was simulated by the QM/MM technique thereby allowing for non-empirical prediction of the absolute two-photon cross section. We report a maximum in the TPA cross section for a medium of intermediate solvent polarity (i.e. in chloroform) and provide the grounds for an explanation of this effect which recently has been experimentally observed for a series of charge transfer species in solvents of different polarity. The calculations of absorption energies reproduce well the positive solvatochromic behavior of DANS and are in good agreement with experimental spectra available for the chloroform and DMSO solvents. In line with recent development of the QM/MM response technique for color modeling, we find this methodology to offer a versatile tool to predict and analyze two-photon absorption phenomena taking place within a medium.},

The data obtained show that donor-acceptor properties of supermolecules: Cz-$\sigma$ (or $\pi$) bridge-acceptors slightly depend on: 1) the number of alkane or alkene groups in the bridges, 2) the presence of $\pi$ bonds, and 3) the various conformations in the bridge. Equilibrium distances between Cz and acceptor molecules in the supramolecular complexes and the sequence of the stability are found taken into account the oriented electrostatic attraction forces. There is a small charge redistribution in the ground state of the Cz-containing supermolecules and supramolecules. These designed derivatives are potential molecular photodiodes. The MNDO calculation data obtained show that the valence bands of the OVK and OEPK are narrow, therefore there is a electron hole hopping transfer mechanism in these systems.},

The theory of images is employed to construct expressions valid in the near-field approximation. This theory is extended to the full electrodynamic theory valid over all distances. Connections are made between the expressions for the image charges and the Fresnel coefficients from optics. It is found that the energy transfer rates are strongly influenced by surface resonances, including the interfacial surface plasmons and the two-dimensional plasmon of a metallic film.

It will be shown that the perturbation parameter introduced by Born and Oppenheimer in separating the electronic and nuclear motion involved in the molecular Sch\"odinger equation, $\lambda = (m/M)1/4$, can be used for this purpose by expanding wavefunctions and energies in power series of $\lambda$.},

For symmetry-forbidden but vibronic-allowed transitions, the first nonvanishing term of the spectral intensity is second order with respect to $\lambda$ and the B-O couplings do not appear in the calculation of the spectral intensity until the fourth order approximation with respect to $\lambda$; in this case, other high order vibronic couplings and anharmonic effect are competing with the B-O couplings.},

  abstract = {Airborne contaminants, e.g., bacterial spores, are usually analyzed by time-consuming microscopic, chemical, and biological assays. Current research into real-time laser spectroscopic detectors of such contaminants is based on e.g., resonance fluorescence. The present approach derives from recent experiments in which atoms and molecules are prepared by one (or more) coherent laser(s) and probed by another set of lasers. However, generating and using maximally coherent oscillation in macromolecules having an enormous number of degrees of freedom is challenging. In particular, the short dephasing times and rapid internal conversion rates are major obstacles. However, adiabatic fast passage techniques and the ability to generate combs of phase-coherent femtosecond pulses provide tools for the generation and utilization of maximal quantum coherence in large molecules and biopolymers. We call this technique FAST CARS (femtosecond adaptive spectroscopic techniques for coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy), and the present article proposes and analyses ways in which it could be used to rapidly identify preselected molecules in real time.},

  abstract = {Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.},

  abstract = {Two-photon excitation is gaining rapidly in interest and significance in spectroscopy and microscopy. Here we introduce a new approach that suggests versatile optical labels suitable for both one- and two-photon excitation and also two-photon-excited ultrasensitive, nondestructive chemical probing. The underlying spectroscopic effect is the incoherent inelastic scattering of two photons on the vibrational quantum states called hyper-Raman scattering (HRS). The rather weak effect can be strengthened greatly if HRS takes place in the local optical fields of gold and silver nanostructures. This so-called surface-enhanced HRS (SEHRS) is the two-photon analogue to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). SEHRS provides structurally sensitive vibrational information complementary to those obtained by SERS. SEHRS combines the advantages of two-photon spectroscopy with the structural information of vibrational spectroscopy and the high-sensitivity and nanometer-scale local confinement of plasmonics-based spectroscopy. We infer effective two-photon cross-sections for SEHRS on the order of 10^{-46} to 10^{-45} cm4\textperiodcentereds, similar to or higher than the best ``action'' cross-sections (product of the two-photon absorption cross-section and fluorescence quantum yield) for two-photon fluorescence, and we demonstrate HRS on biological structures such as single cells after incubation with gold nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Synthesis, characterization, and functionalization of self-assembled, ligand-stabilized gold nanoparticles are long-standing issues in the chemistry of nanomaterials. Factors driving the thermodynamic stability of well documented discrete sizes are largely unknown. Herein, we provide a unified view of principles that underlie the stability of particles protected by thiolate (SR) or phosphine and halide (PR3, X) ligands. The picture has emerged from analysis of large-scale density functional theory calculations of structurally characterized compounds, namely Au102(SR)44, Au39(PR3)14X6, Au11(PR3)7X3, and Au13(PR3)10X2 3+, where X is either a halogen or a thiolate. Attributable to a compact, symmetric core and complete steric protection, each compound has a filled spherical electronic shell and a major energy gap to unoccupied states. Consequently, the exceptional stability is best described by a ''noble-gas superatom'' analogy. The explanatory power of this concept is shown by its application to many monomeric and oligomeric compounds of precisely known composition and structure, and its predictive power is indicated through suggestions offered for a series of anomalously stable cluster compositions which are still awaiting a precise structure determination.},

  abstract = {The computational cost of exact methods for quantum simulation using classical computers grows exponentially with system size. As a consequence, these techniques can be applied only to small systems. By contrast, we demonstrate that quantum computers could exactly simulate chemical reactions in polynomial time. Our algorithm uses the split-operator approach and explicitly simulates all electron-nuclear and interelectronic interactions in quadratic time. Surprisingly, this treatment is not only more accurate than the Born-Oppenheimer approximation but faster and more efficient as well, for all reactions with more than about four atoms. This is the case even though the entire electronic wave function is propagated on a grid with appropriately short time steps. Although the preparation and measurement of arbitrary states on a quantum computer is inefficient, here we demonstrate how to prepare states of chemical interest efficiently. We also show how to efficiently obtain chemically relevant observables, such as state-to-state transition probabilities and thermal reaction rates. Quantum computers using these techniques could outperform current classical computers with 100 qubits.},

  abstract = {Methods are developed for discussing the photon statistics of arbitrary fields in fully quantum-mechanical terms. In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.},

This renormalization effect leads to spatial modulation in the transition frequency and width of the excited state due to its resonant interaction with itself via the radiation field reflected from the mirror.

A particular bound-state solution of the Schr\"odinger equation which belongs to an irreducible representation of the time-translation symmetry group is defined as a steady state, and the characteristic number of the irreducible representation as a quasienergy. It is shown that the defined steady states and quasienergies behave in a newly constructed Hilbert space like stationary states and energies of a conservative system in many respects. It is also shown that for a resonant case the unperturbed quasienergy becomes degenerate and the transitions among discrete levels can be accounted for by the familiar degenerate perturbation procedure.

A number of suitably defined response functions play a basic role in the present approach, as these in conjunction with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem lead to electromagnetic field correlation functions, which describe physical effects such as lifetimes, frequency shifts of the excited states, dispersion forces, etc. The quantization of the electromagnetic field is only implicitly used. A large part of the present paper is devoted to the calculation of the response functions involving different geometries and various types of dielectrics. Both spatially dispersive and spatially nondispersive dielectrics are considered. The response functions are calculated using Maxwell's equations and the usual boundary conditions at the interface adjoining the two mediums. As a first application of the present approach, the black-body fluctuations in finite geometries and the influence of surfaces on its temporal and spatial coherence are studied. An interesting theorem is also proved which enables us to calculate the normally ordered (antinormally ordered) correlation functions from the symmetrized correlation functions.},

  abstract = {A quantum-electrodynamic theory of spontaneous emission in presence of dielectrics and conductors is developed. The theory makes use of the master-equation techniques and the response-function formalism of part I of this series of papers. Various observable entities such as damping coefficients (lifetimes), Lamb shifts, and frequency shifts are related to the appropriate surface-dependent response functions. The results are valid for arbitrary geometries (involving linear dielectrics) and naturally contain, as a special case, the usual results of spontaneous emission in free space. As explicit examples we consider a two-level atom (also the multilevel atom) in presence of a plane dielectric interface and between two conducting plates. Formulas for the shifts and widths are given and their asymptotic behavior for large and short distances is discussed. The behavior when the atom is embedded inside the dielectric is different than when the atom is outside the dielectric. The origin of coherence in the present model is discussed and the coherence effects in this model are contrasted with those in Dicke's model. The results are also compared with those obtained by the image method. Exact expressions for the operator radiation-reaction fields are obtained in terms of the atomic polarization operators and response functions. Approximate results for such fields are also given. The far-zone behavior of the radiation fields is obtained in terms of response functions and the polarization operators. Some of the normally ordered correlation functions are also calculated. The connection of some of the theoretical results with a recent experimental work of Carniglia, Mandel, and Drexhage is discussed. The effect of anisotropy of the dielectric function on the lifetimes as well as on the far-field correlation functions is also considered. Finally the contribution to the shifts and widths due to the excitation of surface polariton modes is computed and the results are compared with those obtained by the quantization of surface polariton field. It is found that such surface modes contribute significantly to widths.},

This leads to an exchange potential that depends on an adjustable parameter a which is different for each atom. The value of this parameter is determined empirically for each atom, usually by equalizing the total energy of the atom calculated by the Xa method to that calculated by Hartree-Fock theory. In this paper an explicit dependence of a on the atomic number Z is developed by considering a linear variation of the Fermi-hole density, with the proper boundary values. This permits the calculation of theoretical a values for all atoms in the periodic table; these are reported. Thesse theoretical a values reproduce the Z dependence of the empirical a values in all details. Further, it is shown that electrons of opposite spin should have different a values-a result that has important consequences in Xa calculations of magnetic properties and hyperfine interactions.},

By the virial theorem, the interacting kinetic and electron-electron repulsion expectation values obey 2T[n]+Vee[n]=-Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇[$\delta$T/$\delta$n(r)+$\delta$Vee/$\delta$n(r)]. The exchange energy functional Ex[n] and potential vx([n];r)≡$\delta$Ex/$\delta$n(r) must satisfy Ex[n]+Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vx([n];r)=0, while the correlation energy and potential must satisfy Ec[n]+Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r)<0. Somewhat counterintuitively, it is not true that T[n$\gamma$]=$\gamma$2T[n] and Vee[n$\gamma$]=$\gamma$Vee[n], where n$\gamma$(r)≡$\gamma$3n($\gamma$r) is a scaled density with scale factor $\gamma$≠1. In fact, it is impossible to partition the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional into a piece that scales as $\gamma$2 and a piece that scales as $\gamma$, even if complete freedom with the partitioning is allowed. Instead there are universal scaling inequalities. For instance, T[n$\gamma$]+Vee[n$\gamma$]<$\gamma$2T[n]+ $\gamma$Vee[n] and T[n$\gamma$]+$\gamma$Vee[n$\gamma$]>$\gamma$2(T[n ]+Vee[n]), and consequent inequalities involving Ec[n]. All the above virial and scaling requisites are universal in that they are independent of external potential and they must hold for arbitrary proper n. In addition, for the ground-state energy (E) and n of any atom or molecule at its equilibrium nuclear configuration, there is the inequality E<-Ts[n], where Ts is the noninteracting kinetic energy. In the closed-shell tight-binding limit, the correlation potential obeys Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r)=0, and so cannot be a monotonic function of r for an atom in this limit. Further, (∂/∂$\gamma$)Ec[n$\gamma$]\textbardbl$\gamma$=1=E c[n]+Tc[n]=-Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r), which implies that the exact Ec should be fairly insensitive to scaling. With the help of the ionization-potential theorem, it is argued that the exact vc([n];r) in an atom often has a positive part. Common approximations to the correlation potential are examined for their effects upon the highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy and the density moment 〈r2〉, and these effects are found to be related. Further improvements needed in the approximate correlation potentials are relatively large, but not nearly so large as those recently suggested for the atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe: The discrepancy between theoretical values of 〈r2〉 from Hartree-Fock or configuration-interaction calculations, and experimental values from measured diamagnetic susceptibilities, is tentatively resolved in favor of theory.},

Fulfilment of these requirements is checked for existing gradient-corrected potentials. In order to examine the behavior of approximate potentials over all space we compare these potentials with exact Kohn-Sham potentials calculated from correlated densities using a newly developed iterative procedure. The main failures in the existing gradient-corrected potentials arise in the asymptotic region of the atom where these potentials decay too fast and at the atomic nucleus where the potentials exhibit a Coulomb-like singular behavior. We show that the main errors can be corrected by a simple potential in terms of the density and its gradients leading to considerably improved one-electron energies compared to the local-density approximation. For Be and Ne it is shown that the electron density is improved in the outer region.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous decay of an excited atom near a dispersing and absorbing microsphere of given complex permittivity that satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations is studied, with special emphasis on a Drude-Lorentz permittivity. Both the whispering gallery field resonances below the band gap (for a dielectric sphere) and the surface-guided field resonances inside the gap (for a dielectric or a metallic sphere) are considered. Since the decay rate mimics the spectral density of the sphere-assisted ground-state fluctuation of the radiation field, the strengths and widths of the field resonances essentially determine the feasible enhancement of spontaneous decay. In particular, strong enhancement can be observed for transition frequencies within the interval in which the surface-guided field resonances strongly overlap. When material absorption becomes significant, then the highly structured emission pattern that can be observed when radiative losses dominate, reduces to that of a strongly absorbing mirror. Accordingly, nonradiative decay becomes dominant. In particular, if the distance between the atom and the surface of the microsphere is small enough, the decay becomes purely nonradiative.},

Interaction effects between a general molecular system and a spatially anisotropic metal particle supporting plasmon excitations in the presence of an external radiation field are systematically included through many-body perturbation theory. Reduction of the exact effects of molecular-electronic correlation to the level of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory is made for practical initial implementation, while description of collective oscillations of conduction electrons in the metal is reduced to that of a classical plasma density; extension of the former to a Kohn-Sham density-functional or second-order M?ller-Plesset perturbation theory is discussed; further specialization of the latter to the random-phase approximation allows for several salient features of the formalism to be highlighted without need for numerical computation. Scattering and linear-response properties of the coupled system subjected to an external perturbing electric field in the electric-dipole interaction approximation are investigated. Both damping and finite-lifetime effects of molecular-electronic excitations as well as the characteristic fourth-power enhancement of the molecular Raman scattering intensity are elucidated from first principles. It is demonstrated that the presented theory reduces to previous models of surface-enhanced Raman scattering and leads naturally to a semiclassical picture of the response of a quantum-mechanical molecular system interacting with a spatially anisotropic classical metal particle with electronic polarization approximated by a discretized collection of electric dipoles.},

  abstract = {We construct a nonlocal density functional approximation with full exact exchange, while preserving the constraint-satisfaction approach and justified error cancellations of simpler semilocal functionals. This is achieved by interpolating between different approximations suitable for two extreme regions of the electron density. In a "normal" region, the exact exchange-correlation hole density around an electron is semilocal because its spatial range is reduced by correlation and because it integrates over a narrow range to -1. These regions are well described by popular semilocal approximations (many of which have been constructed nonempirically), because of proper accuracy for a slowly varying density or because of error cancellation between exchange and correlation. "Abnormal" regions, where nonlocality is unveiled, include those in which exchange can dominate correlation (one-electron, nonuniform high density, and rapidly varying limits), and those open subsystems of fluctuating electron number over which the exact exchange-correlation hole integrates to a value greater than -1. Regions between these extremes are described by a hybrid functional mixing exact and semilocal exchange energy densities locally, i.e., with a mixing fraction that is a function of position r and a functional of the density. Because our mixing fraction tends to 1 in the high-density limit, we employ full exact exchange according to the rigorous definition of the exchange component of any exchange-correlation energy functional. Use of full exact exchange permits the satisfaction of many exact constraints, but the nonlocality of exchange also requires balanced nonlocality of correlation. We find that this nonlocality can demand at least five empirical parameters, corresponding roughly to the four kinds of abnormal regions. Our local hybrid functional is perhaps the first accurate fourth-rung density functional or hyper-generalized gradient approximation, with full exact exchange, that is size-consistent in the way that simpler functionals are. It satisfies other known exact constraints, including exactness for all one-electron densities, and provides an excellent fit to the 223 molecular enthalpies of formation of the G3/99 set and the 42 reaction barrier heights of the BH42/03 set, improving both (but especially the latter) over most semilocal functionals and global hybrids. Exact constraints, physical insights, and paradigm examples hopefully suppress "overfitting."},

We find considerable changes from the pure image-theory result given by us earlier, in particular for the molecular transition dipole moment oriented parallel to the metal surface. The coupling to the surface-plasmon excitation spectrum induces a rapidly increasing contribution to the linewidth of the decaying molecule with decreasing distance from the metal surface. As the image result for the case of a molecular transition dipole oriented parallel to the surface tends to zero with decreasing distance, the inclusion of the coupling to surface plasmons drastically affects the lifetime of this configuration. For both cases, i.e., transition dipole parallel and perpendicular to the metal surface, the contribution to the width due to coupling to surface excitations diverges with decreasing distance, leading to dramatic shortening of the lifetime of the decaying molecule due to conversion of the localized electronic energy into surface charge-density oscillations.},

@ARTICLE{prb_13_4274,
  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to advocate the usefulness of the spin-density-functional (SDF) formalism. The generalization of the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham scheme to and SDF formalism is presented in its thermodynamic version. The ground-state formalism is extended to more general Hamiltonians and to the lowest excited state of each symmetry. A relation between the exchange-correlation functional and the pair correlation function is derived. It is used for the interpretation of approximate versions of the theory, in particular the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation, which is formally valid only in the limit of slow and weak spatial variation in the density. It is shown, however, to give good account for the exchange-correlation energy also in rather inhomogeneous situations, because only the spherical average of the exchange-correlation hole influences this energy, and because it fulfills the sum rule stating that this hole should contain only one charge unit. A further advantage of the LSD approximation is that it can be systematically improved. Calculations on the homogeneous spin-polarized electron liquid are reported on. These calculations provide data in the form of interpolation formulas for the exchange-correlation energy and potentials, to be used in the LSD approximation. The ground-state properties are obtained from the Galitskii-Migdal formula, which relates the total energy to the one-electron spectrum, obtained with a dynamical self-energy. The self-energy is calculated in an electron-plasmon model where the electron is assumed to couple to one single mode. The potential for excited states is obtained by identifying the quasiparticle peak in the spectrum. Correlation is found to significantly weaken the spin dependence of the potentials, compared with the result in the Hartree-Fock approximation. Charge and spin response functions are calculated in the long-wavelength limit. Correlation is found to be very important for properties which involve a change in the spinpolarization. For atoms, molecules, and solids the usefulness of the SDF formalism is discussed. In order to explore the range of applicability, a few applications of the LSD approximation are made on systems for which accurate solutions exist. The calculated ionization potentials, affinities, and excitation energies for atoms propose that the valence electrons are fairly well described, a typical error in the ionization energy being 1/2 eV. The exchange-correlation holes of two-electron ions are discussed. An application to the hydrogen molecule, using a minimum basis set, shows that the LSD approximation gives good results for the energy curve for all separations studied, in contrast to the spin-independent local approximation. In particular, the error in the binding energy is only 0.1 eV, and bond breaking is properly described. For solids, the SDF formalism provides a framework for band models of magnetism. An estimate of the splitting between spin-up and spin-down energy bands of a ferromagnetic transition metal shows that the LSD approximation gives a correction of the correct sign and order of magnitude to published Xa results. To stimulate further use of the SDF formalism in the LSD approximation, the paper is self-contained and describes the necessary formulas and input data for the potentials.},

The main results were the shift of bulk and surface plasma frequencies with aggregation density and the appearance of an extra resonance, called the optical conduction resonance (OCR), on the low-energy side of the plasma frequency. The OCR was shown to be a transverse collective mode of the free electrons in the aggregates which could be excited by incident light. In the present work the effects of electronic interband transitions on the free-electron OCR and the free-electron plasma frequencies are examined. Important new results are obtained including frequency shifts and splitting of the OCR absorption peak and the loss function by interband transitions. These results are used in the analysis of the dielectric functions of some real metals in aggregated form.},

  abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

  abstract = {We have developed a theory for the properties of vibrational excitations in molecules adsorbed on a metal surface. The coherent potential approximation (CPA) is used in the treatment of the vibrational interaction between the molecules. We show, by interpreting infrared spectra of substitutionally disordered systems consisting of isotopic mixtures of CO on Cu(100), that the molecules interact mainly through their dipole fields. We also show that in interpreting the integrated absorptance in infrared spectroscopy or the relative loss intensity in electron-energy-loss spectroscopy it is necessary to take into account the screening due to the electronic polarizability of the adsorbed molecules. A simplified version of the CPA result is used for a discussion of the absorption spectra of partial monolayers of one isotope. With the assumption that the CO molecules are randomly distributed, comparison between theory and experiment indicates that the dipole-dipole interaction alone is responsible for the coverage-dependent frequency shift for CO adsorbed on a transition metal [Ru(001)], whereas there is an almost equally large counteracting chemical shift on a noble metal [Cu(100)]. The meaning and origin of the dynamical dipole moment of adsorbed CO molecules are discussed. We find that the increase of the dynamical dipole moment (by a factor 2-3) upon adsorption probably is due to charge oscillations between CO 2\pi* molecular orbitals and the metal. Finally, we outline how the theory developed here can be applied to a fundamental step in photosynthesis.},

Calculated exchange energies for atoms fall within 1% of Hartree-Fock values.

  abstract = {A model calculation of the vibrational line shape of adsorbates at metal surfaces damped by the generation of electron-hole pairs is presented. Two vibrational excitations are considered, one fundamental and one overtone. To calculate the total absorption of a radiation field by the system, we use the formalism developed in the preceding paper to include contributions, $\alpha$⊥ and $\alpha$?, from the respective E-field components perpendicular and parallel to the surface. The generalized asymmetric Fano line-shape formula is shown to apply to both the fundamental and the overtone. For each case, the isotope effect on the line-shape parameters is obtained both in the limits of weak and strong breakdown of adiabaticity, where the weak- or strong-breakdown limit is modeled by assuming a flat spectral density near the Fermi level, or a sharp structure in that region on top of the flat part. It is found that a strong breakdown of adiabaticity weakens the isotope dependence of the asymmetry factor and the linewidth, while the isotope effect for the excitation strength remains the same as in the weak-breakdown limit. The magnitude of the excitation strength is modified as the strong-breakdown limit is reached. These conclusions remain valid whether the vibration contributes to $\alpha$⊥ or to $\alpha$?. When applied to the wag overtone of hydrogen on W(100), reasonably good agreement is found between the theory in the strong-breakdown limit and experiment assuming that the overtone absorption is given by $\alpha$⊥, the perpendicular response. We also discuss other possibilities for the measured absorption, including the contribution from the overtone by $\alpha$?, the tangential response, and from other excitations nearby in frequency.},

The scheme is applicable to all kinds of adiabatic perturbations of the crystal ground state, such as the application of mechanical strains, static electric fields of any wavelength, or individual atomic displacements, and allows the study of coefficients which describe anharmonicities or coupling of simultaneously applied disturbances. Total-energy changes as a function of the perturbation wavelength, as needed to obtain phonon group velocities, can also be considered. The formalism, which avoids the use of supercells and large-matrix inversions, contains as a special case the treatment of linear-response coefficients recently suggested by Baroni, Giannozi, and Testa. The central ingredient in our scheme is an efficient use of the ``2n+1'' theorem of the perturbation theory, which allows us to obtain the third-order derivatives of the total energy by using only byproducts of a first-order perturbation calculation.},

  abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3-4 % is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

We start from the exact relation \chi_e =\sum_i p_i{\chi_i}<(E⋅E)^2>_{i,lin}/ E_0^4, where \chi_i and p_i are the cubic nonlinear susceptibility and volume fraction of the ith component, E_0 is the applied electric field, and <E^4>_{i,lin} is the expectation value of the electric field in the ith component, calculated in the linear limit where \chi_i=0. In our numerical work, we represent the composite by a random resistor or impedance network, calculating the electric-field distributions by a generalized transfer-matrix algorithm. Under certain conditions, we find that \chi_e is greatly enhanced near the percolation threshold. We also find a large enhancement for a linear fractal in a nonlinear host. In a random Drude metal-insulator composite \chi_e is hugely enhanced especially near frequencies which correspond to the surface-plasmon resonance spectrum of the composite. At zero frequency, the random composite results are reasonably well described by a nonlinear effective-medium approximation. The finite-frequency enhancement shows very strong reproducible structure which is nearly undetectable in the linear response of the composite, and which may possibly be described by a generalized nonlinear effective-medium approximation. The fractal results agree qualitatively with a nonlinear differential effective-medium approximation. Finally, we consider a suspension of coated spheres embedded in a host. If the coating is nonlinear, we show that \chi_e/\chi_{coat}≫1 near the surface-plasmon resonance frequency of the core particle.},

Enhancement associated with particle clustering is found for a number of optical processes, including four-wave mixing (FWM), third-harmonic generation (THG), Raman scattering, and nonlinear refraction and absorption in Kerr media. Field fluctuations and optical nonlinear susceptibilities are especially large in fractal clusters. The enhancement of optical processes is expressed in terms of the resonant linear absorption by collective dipolar eigenmodes in a cluster, and quality factors, q, of the modes (q≫1). It is shown that the susceptibility of a composite material consisting of random small-particle clusters is proportional to q3 for Raman scattering and the Kerr optical nonlinearity, and to q4 and q6 for THG and FWM, respectively. For all of these processes, a spectral dependence of the effective susceptibility is found. Broad-scale numerical simulations of the optical response in small-particle composites are performed to complement the theory. The simulations are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data.},

  abstract = {We present a structural and vibrational analysis of several amorphous (disordered) and ordered isomers of a 55-atom gold cluster. A Gupta n-body potential, with parameters fitted to gold clusters, was used to model the metallic bonding in the Au55 cluster. The molecular-dynamics method combined with simulated annealing and quenching techniques were used to perform the cluster structure optimization. Our results show that several nonequivalent and nearly degenerate in energy amorphous cluster structures are more stable than those with high symmetry like the 55-atom Mackay icosahedron and the fcc cuboctahedron. The calculated distribution of normal frequencies clearly discriminates between amorphous and ordered cluster configurations and confirms their stability. A common-neighbor analysis was implemented to characterize the disordered cluster structures, identifying the short-range order of the amorphous phase, according to the local environment of each atom pair in the cluster. Distorted multilayer icosahedral order was found to be the more representative of the amorphous clusters with the lowest energies. At higher energies, the amorphous structures are characterized by the presence of distorted local icosahedral order. The origin of the higher stability of amorphous vs ordered isomers in Au55 is in the short range of the n-body interaction existing in the metal cluster bonding.},

Our GGA hole recovers the Perdew-Wang 1991 and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA's for the exchange-correlation energy, which therefore respect the same powerful hole constraints as LSD.

  abstract = {With more explanation than usual and without appeal to Janak's theorem, we review the statement and proof of the ionization potential theorems for the exact Kohn-Sham density-functional theory of a many-electron system: (1) For any average electron number N between the integers Z-1 and Z, and thus for N\textrightarrowZ from below, the highest occupied or partly occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy is minus the ionization energy of the Z-electron system. (2) For Z-1<N<Z, the exact Kohn-Sham effective potential vs(r) tends to zero as |r|\textrightarrow∞. We then argue that an objection to these theorems. [L. Kleinman, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12 042 (1997)] overlooks a crucial step in the proof of theorem (2): The asymptotic exponential decay of the exact electron density of the Z-electron system is controlled by the exact ionization energy, but the decay of an approximate density is not controlled by the approximate ionization energy. We review relevant evidence from the numerical construction of the exact Kohn-Sham potential. In particular, we point out a model two-electron problem for which the ionization potential theorems are exactly confirmed. Finally, we comment on related issues: the self-interaction correction, the discontinuity of the exact Kohn-Sham potential as N passes through the integer Z, and the generalized sum rule on the exchange-correlation hole.},

Disordered structures are also isomers of nickel and silver clusters but they are not among the global minima of these metals. Comparison of the structure factors of the disordered and ordered isomers of gold with published experimental x-ray powder diffraction data suggests that the disordered structures are real.

A 3-nm InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) is positioned 12 nm from an 8-nm silver layer, well within the surface plasmon fringing field depth. A spectrally sharp photoluminescence dip, by a factor `55, indicates that electron-hole energy is being rapidly transferred to plasmon excitation, due to the spatial overlap between the semiconductor QW and the surface plasmon electric field. Thus, spontaneous emission into surface plasmons is $\sim$55 times faster than normal spontaneous emission from InGaN quantum wells. If efficient antenna structures can be incorporated into the metal film, there could be a corresponding increase in external light emission efficiency.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the structure of clusters is essential to predict many of their physical and chemical properties. Using a many-body semiempirical Gupta potential (to perform global minimizations), and first-principles density functional calculations (to confirm the energy ordering of the local minima), we have recently found [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1600 (1998)] that there are many intermediate-size disordered gold nanoclusters with energy near or below the lowest-energy ordered structure. This is especially surprising because we studied ``magic'' cluster sizes, for which very compact-ordered structures exist. Here, we show how the analysis of the local stress can be used to understand the physical origin of this amorphization. We find that the compact ordered structures, which are very stable for pair potentials, are destabilized by the tendency of metallic bonds to contract at the surface, because of the decreased coordination. The amorphization is also favored by the relatively low energy associated to bondlength and coordination disorder in metals. Although these are very general properties of metallic bonding, we find that they are especially important in the case of gold, and we predict some general trends in the tendency of metallic clusters towards amorphous structures.},

  abstract = {Many organic materials (disordered and crystalline as well) have rather broad and dispersionless electronic resonances. The excitations in these materials are localized, and thus for these excitations the wave vector is not a ``good'' quantum number. We analyze the optical properties of exciton polaritons in a microcavity, which utilize such organic materials as the optically active semiconductor. We show that as a result of strong light-matter coupling two polariton branches appear in the microcavity, which are analogous to the cavity-polariton branches observed in inorganic semiconductor structures. However, in contrast to the case of polaritons in inorganic semiconductors, the lower polariton branch exists only in a certain restricted intervals of wave vector values. We also show that in such materials the majority of the electronic excited states do not strongly couple to the cavity photon, and these states can be regarded as essentially incoherent. Applying this physical picture for the microcavities containing disordered cyanine dye J aggregates, we examine the decay of the upper cavity polaritons accompanied by the emission of an intramolecular phonon. We show that the main contribution to the upper polariton nonradiative decay rate arises from the transition to incoherent states, and the transition is very fast (of the order of 50 fs). From the results of our calculations we discuss the dynamics of excitations in a microcavity containing organic materials},

Considering a small spherical particle, we express the extinction cross section via the total electric-field Green's tensor of a metal-dielectric interface structure. Analytic expressions are derived for the parts of Green's tensor that govern the excitation of p- and s-polarized waves propagating away from the interface, and waves propagating along and being localized at the interface, viz., surface plasmon polaritons $\sim$SPP's!. This allows us in turn to divide the extinction cross section into parts associated with scattering of light into different types of electromagnetic waves. The scattering cross sections related to SPP-to-SPP scattering, and scattering of SPP's into waves propagating away from the interface, are studied with respect to the dielectric constant of the metal and the height of the scatterer above the interface. In the case where the light wavelength is close to the SPP resonance, the SPP-to-SPP scattering cross section can be orders of magnitude larger compared to the extinction cross section of a particle in free space, whereas in the case of a nearly perfect conductor, the SPP-to-SPP cross section tends to 0. The efficiency of SPP-to-SPP scattering is calculated and, e.g., for the metal dielectric constant 2100 $\sim$order of magnitude for gold at the light wavelength 1500 nm! it is found to be above 60% for the optimum scatterer-surface distance.},

The model molecule has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase by some 10 orders of magnitude (to $\sim$10-14 cm2 ) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser intensities $\sim$1 mW/\mum2 .},

  abstract = {We present an analytic theory for the optical properties of ellipsoidal plasmonic particles covered by anisotropic molecular layers. The theory is applied to the case of a prolate spheroid covered by chromophores oriented parallel and perpendicular to the metal surface. For the case that the molecular layer resonance frequency is close to being degenerate with one of the particle plasmon resonances strong hybridization between the two resonances occurs. Approximate analytic expressions for the hybridized resonance frequencies, their extinction cross-section peak heights, and widths are derived. The strength of the molecular-plasmon interaction is found to be strongly dependent on molecular orientation and suggests that this sensitivity could be the basis for novel nanoparticle based bio- and chemo-sensing applications.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the calculation of the polarization properties of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This model describes each atom by both a net electric charge and a dipole. Compared to dipole-only models, the consideration of electric charges enables one to account for the displacement of free electrons in structures subject to an external field. It also enables one to account for the accumulation of additional charges. By expressing the electrostatic interactions in terms of normalized propagators, the model achieves a better consistency as well as an improved stability. In its most elementary form, the model depends on a single adjustable parameter and provides an excellent agreement with other experimental and theoretical data. The technique is applied to a C720 fullerene and to open and closed (5,5) nanotubes. The simulations demonstrate the improved stability of our algorithm. In addition, they quantify the role of free charges in the polarization of these structures. The paper finally investigates the field-enhancement properties of open and closed (5,5) nanotubes.},

  abstract = {Static polarizabilities and optical absorption spectra for the ground state structures of gold clusters (Aun, n=2-14 and 20) are investigated from first principles within static and time-dependent density functional theory. The static polarizabilities of clusters with less than 14 atoms generally increase as a function of size modulated by even-odd oscillations. The polarizabilities of Au14 and Au20 are noticeably lower due to the shape transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional structures at n=14. The analyses of the optical absorption spectra calculated within the time-dependent local density approximation indicate that the d electrons in Aun clusters are significantly more involved in low-energy transitions and give rise to more quenched oscillator strengths (by screening the s electrons) than in Agn clusters. These stronger effects of the d electrons in the optical properties of Aun are due to the larger degree of proximity of the s and d levels in the Au atom as compared to the Ag atom, which gives rise to stronger s-(p)-d hybridization in the molecular orbitals of Aun. The calculated spectra are found to be in good agreement with experimental data and results from earlier studies for the available sizes.},

  abstract = {The number of self-consistent-field iterations needed for the density-functional theory treatment of metallic systems grows with the size of the unit cell, not only for basic algorithms like simple mixing, but also for more advanced schemes, in which results from several past steps are mixed. Preconditioning techniques have the potential to suppress this growth, although the available methods have strong limitations: either they deliver little improvement in case of mixed systems with metallic and nonmetallic regions, or the computation of the preconditioner scales badly with the size of the system, with a large prefactor. We propose an approximate preconditioner, with tremendously reduced prefactor, that makes the number of self-consistent cycle nearly independent of the size of the system, and bears little overhead up to the one hundred atom range. The susceptibility matrix, a key ingredient in our scheme, is approximated thanks to the closure relation. Instead of using the exact formulation of the dielectric matrix, we rely on the random-phase approximation, that allows to further decrease the prefactor thanks to a very low wave vector cutoff, even for systems with both vacuum and a metallic region. We test this algorithm for systems of increasing size and demonstrate its practical usefulness.},

  abstract = {We performed density-functional calculations aimed to investigate the adsorption mechanism of a single pyridine (C5H5N) molecule on Cu(110) and Ag(110) surfaces. Our ab initio simulations show that, in the ground state, the pyridine molecule adsorbs with its molecular plane perpendicular to these substrates and is oriented along the [001] direction. In this case, the bonding mechanism involves a sigma bond through the lone-pair electrons of the nitrogen atom. When the heterocyclic ring is parallel to the surface, the bonding takes place via pi-like molecular orbitals. However, depending on the position of the N atom on the surface, the planar adsorption configuration can relax to a perpendicular geometry. The role of the long-range van der Waals interactions on the adsorption geometries and energies was analyzed in the framework of the semiempirical method proposed by Grimme [J. Comput. Chem. 27, 1787 (2006)]. We demonstrate that these dispersion effects are very important for geometry and electronic structure of flat adsorption configurations.},

  abstract = {Electronic excitations in linear atomic chains of simple and noble metals (silver) have been studied using time-dependent density-functional theory. The formation and development of collective resonances in the absorption spectra were obtained as functions of the chain length. A longitudinal collective resonance appears in both simple- and noble-metal chains. Its dispersion has been deduced and is compared with that of a one-dimensional electron gas. The transverse excitation generally shows a bimodal structure, which can be assigned as the ``end and central resonances.'' The d electrons of silver atoms reduce both the energies and intensities of the transverse modes but have little effect on its longitudinal resonance. This anisotropic screening is determined by the interband (d\textrightarrowp) transition, which is involved only in transverse oscillations. Analysis of these results yields a general picture of plasmon resonances in one-dimensional atomic structures. Implications of such atomic-scale plasmons to surface plasmons in larger dimensions are also discussed.},

Vertical ionization potentials and electron affinities are calculated within the so-called ⌬SCF and GW approximations. Results are compared with experimental data. For molecular orbitals of predominantly sp character, the GW results are found to be in good agreement with experiment. For orbitals of mainly d character, good agreement with experiment can be achieved only via the use of semicore pseudopotentials, due to strong correlations among 4s, 4p, and 4d electrons. Optical excitations are computed within the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) and by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for electrons and holes. For most clusters, the TDLDA spectra are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The optical excitations computed with the BSE method, on the other hand, are generally in poor agreement with experiment, especially as size increases. This finding is explained in terms of the nonlocality of the BSE kernel and correlations involving 4d electrons. We also discuss the roles played by self-consistency, vertex corrections, and satellite structures in the GW results of these confined systems with d valence electrons.},

  abstract = {The electronic coupling between metal nanoparticles is responsible for intriguing new phenomena observed when the particles are near touching contact, which is exemplified by recent investigations of nanoparticle dimers. However, little is known about the role of the molecular orbitals of the nanoparticle dimers. The expectation is that the physics and chemistry of the system must be reflected in the orbitals that control the bonding at touching contact. This expectation is borne out in the present investigation in which we present a comprehensive theoretical study based on density-functional theory of the electronic coupling between two silver nanoparticles. We explain our findings by studying the molecular orbitals of the dimers as a function of the separation and relative orientation between the nanoparticles. We show that as the nanoparticles approach each other a bond-forming step takes place, and that the strength of the hybridization is a key element to determine various properties of the system. We find that the relative orientation between the nanoparticles plays an important role in determining the strength of the coupling which can be visualized by the spatial distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Moreover, the strength of the coupling will in turn determine the ease of their transition to the nonlinear dielectric-response regime. This effect allows for the tunability of the electronic coupling and magnetic moment of the dimer. Our findings are essential for understanding and tailoring desired physical and chemical properties of closely aggregated nanoparticles relevant for applications such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering and quantum transport in molecular devices.},

  abstract = {A surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is an electromagnetic excitation existing on the surface of a good metal. It is an intrinsically two-dimensional excitation whose electromagnetic field decays exponentially with distance from the surface. In the past, it was possible to study only the (far-field) scattered light produced by the interaction of surface polaritons with surface features. Only with the development of scanning near-field optical microscopy did it become possible to measure the surface polariton field directly in close proximity to the surface where the SPP exists. Here we overview the near-field studies of surface polaritons on randomly rough and nanostructured surfaces, theoretical models of SPP interaction with surface features, and SPP applications in novel photonic technologies. Surface polariton scattering, interference, backscattering, and localization will be discussed, as well as concepts of surface polariton optics and polaritonic crystals. Surface polaritons are finding an ever increasing number of applications in traditional domains of surface characterization and sensors as well as in newly emerging nano-photonic and optoelectronic technologies.},

  abstract = {In near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), the measured fluorescence lifetime of a single dye molecule can be shortened or lengthened, sensitively dependent on the relative position between the molecule and aluminum coated fiber tip. The modified lifetimes and other emission characteristics are simulated by solving Maxwell equations with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The 2D computation reveals insight into the lifetime behaviors and provides guidance for nonperturbative spectroscopic measurements with NSOM. This new methodology is capable of predicting molecular emission properties in front of a metal/dielectric interface of arbitrary geometry.},

The observed electron density of states is not the expected simple electron shell structure, but is strongly influenced by electron-lattice interactions. Only Cu55- and Ag55- exhibit highly degenerate states. This is a direct consequence of their icosahedral symmetry, as is confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Neighboring sizes exhibit perturbed electronic structures, as they are formed by removal or addition of atoms to the icosahedron and therefore have lower symmetries. Gold clusters in the same size range show completely different spectra with almost no degeneracy, which indicates that they have structures of much lower symmetry. This behavior is related to strong relativistic bonding effects in gold, as demonstrated by ab initio calculations for Au55-.},

Microcavity polaritons result from coupling between the 0-0 excitonic transition of 3,4,7,8 napthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and a cavity photon. For thicker films, the 0-1 transition also couples to the cavity mode, as vibronic relaxation is overcome by the short Rabi period for strong coupling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of strong coupling between a cavity photon and multiple vibronic transitions in a single material, made possible by the pronounced vibronic absorption features characteristic of crystalline organic materials.},

Using a simple approximation, we develop an electronic structure theory that combines a new local correlation energy (based on Monte Carlo calculations applied to the homogeneous electron gas) and a combination of local and explicit long-ranged exchange. The theory is applied to several first-row atoms and diatomic molecules where encouraging results are obtained: good description of the chemical bond at the same time allowing for bound anions, reasonably accurate affinity energies, and correct polarizability of an elongated hydrogen chain. Further stringent tests of DFT are passed, concerning ionization potential and charge distribution under large bias.},

The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects, previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole approximation.},

The theory considers the modulation of the polarizability of a metal nanocluster or a flat metal surface by the vibrational motion of an adsorbed molecule. The modulated polarization of the substrate coupled with the incident light will contribute to the Raman scattering enhancement. We show that for a metal cluster and for a flat metal surface this new chemical contribution may enhance the Raman scattering intensity by a factor of $\sim$102 and $\sim$104, respectively. The new SERS process is determined by the electric field parallel to the surface of the metal substrate at the molecular binding site.},

We compute such corrections to the Lamb shift, the Landau levels, and the tunneling current in a scanning tunneling microscope. We show that these corrections can be interpreted in two ways: (a) either that they are exceedingly small, beyond the reach of current experiments, or (b) that they predict upper bounds on the quantum gravity parameter in the GUP, compatible with experiments at the electroweak scale. Thus, more accurate measurements in the future should either be able to test these predictions, or further tighten the above bounds and predict an intermediate length scale between the electroweak and the Planck scale.},

  abstract = {We study the electronic coupling between two silver nanoparticles using ab initio density functional theory for real atoms. We show that the electronic coupling depends on both the gap size of the dimer system and the relative orientation of the particles. As the two particles are separated from touching contact, the dimer undergoes a bond-breaking step, which also establishes the striking existence of an optimal gap size defined by a maximal static polarizability of the dimer. For some dimers, the electronic coupling before the bond breaking can be strong enough to give rise to a net magnetic moment of the dimer, even though the isolated particles are nonmagnetic. These findings may be instrumental in understanding and controlling the physical and chemical properties of closely packed nanoparticle aggregates.},

Density functional theory calculations of the static Raman tensor demonstrate a strong mode-dependent modification of benzene thiol Raman spectra by Au substrates. Raman active modes with the largest enhancements result from stronger contributions from Au to their electron-vibron coupling, as quantified through a deformation potential. A straightforward and general analysis is introduced to extract chemical enhancement from experiments for specific vibrational modes; measured values are in excellent agreement with our calculations.},

A general formula for the transition probabilities between rovibronic states is derived in the rigid rotor approximation. Similarly to Raman theory the intensity of the rotational lines can be attributed to three independent contributions, which derive from the siotropic, antisymmetric and anisotropic part of the TPA-tensor. Each of these contributions carries a different geometrical factor so that they may be distinguished by polarization experiments. It follows directly from the theory that different rotational branches of one and the same band may differ in their polarization behaviour. Until recently, the latter effect, although central to symmetry assignments, has been overlooked. Application to the asymmetric rotor is discussed in detail and two-photon rotational band contour calculations of naphthalene-h8 are presented.},

On metal surfaces, vibrational energy flow occurs on a femto-to picosecond time scale and competing energy dissipation channels in this time range determine the outcome of chemical reactions at surfaces. Fundamental questions of relaxation time, mode selectivity, importance of intra- versus intermolecular coupling and coupling between electronic and vibrational states can now be tackled for relatively complex adsorbates and surfaces. This review looks at the state-of-the-art of surface vibrational dynamics across a wide range of vibrational spectroscopies and the challenges and exciting prospects that lie ahead to further not only our understanding but also the control of vibrational energy flow in model systems as well as real-world problems.},

  abstract = {The present paper contains a discussion of some optical properties of a medium containing minute metal spheres. The discussion is divided into two Parts: the first part dealing with colours in metal glasses, in which the proportion of volume occupied by metal is small; the second Part dealing with metal films, in which this proportion may have any value from zero to unity. In Part I, the observations of Siedentopf and Zsigmondy beyond the limit of microscopic vision ('Ann. der. Phys.,' January, 1903) are discussed. It is shown that the particles seen in a gold ruby glass are particles of gold which, when their diameters are less than 0.1\mu, are accurately spherical. I have endeavoured to show the the presence of many of these minute spheres to a wave-length of light in the glass will account for all the optical properties of "regular" gold ruby glass, and that the irregularities in colour and in polarisation effects sometimes exhibited by gold glass are due to excessive distance between consecutive gold particles or to excessive size of such particles, the latter, however, involving the former. It is also shown that the radiation from radium is capable of producing in gold glass the ruby colour which is generally produced by re-heating. The method adopted enables us to predict from a knowledge of the metal present in metallic form in a glass what colour that glass will be in its "regular" state. In Part II, the optical properties, and the changes in colour on heating, of the silver and gold films observed by Mr. G. T. Beilby ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 72, p. 226), and of the potassium and sodium films deposited on glass by Professor R. W. Wood ('Phil. Mag.,' p. 396, 1902), are discussed, with a view to showing that they can be accounted for by supposing the films to be composed of minute metal spheres of varying sizes.},

Bistable rotaxanes have been assembled into nanowire crossbar devices, where they may be switched between low- and high-conductivity states, forming the basis for a molecular memory. These memory devices have been scaled to densities of 10 bits cm, the 2020 node for memory of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. Investigations of the kinetics and thermodynamics associated with the electromechanical switching processes of several bistable [2]rotaxane derivatives in solution, self-assembled monolayers on gold, polymer electrolyte gels and in molecular switch tunnel junction devices are consistent with a single, universal switching mechanism whose speed is dependent largely on the environment, as well as on the structure of the switching molecule. X-ray reflectometry studies of the bistable rotaxanes assembled into Langmuir monolayers also lend support to an oxidatively driven mechanical switching process. Structural information obtained from Fourier transform reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy of rotaxane monolayers taken before and after evaporation of a Ti top electrode confirmed that the functionality responsible for switching is not affected by the metal deposition process. All the considerable experimental data, taken together with detailed computational work, support the hypothesis that the tunnelling current hysteresis, which forms the basis of memory operation, is a direct result of the electromechanical switching of the bistable rotaxanes.},

Our scheme allows one to realize both coherent as well as dissipative dynamics of complex spin models involving many-body interactions and constraints. The central building block of the simulation scheme is constituted by a mesoscopic Rydberg gate that permits the entanglement of several atoms in an efficient, robust and quick protocol. In addition, optical pumping on ancillary atoms provides the dissipative ingredient for engineering the coupling between the system and a tailored environment. As an illustration, we discuss how the simulator enables the simulation of coherent evolution of quantum spin models such as the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and Kitaev's toric code, which involves four-body spin interactions. We moreover show that in principle also the simulation of lattice fermions can be achieved. As an example for zcontrolled dissipative dynamics, we discuss ground state cooling of frustration-free spin Hamiltonians.},

  abstract = {We investigate quantum information processing, transfer and storage in hybrid systems comprised of diverse blocks integrated on chips. Strong coupling between superconducting (SC) qubits and ensembles of ultracold atoms or NV-center spins is mediated by a microwave transmission-line resonator that interacts near-resonantly with the atoms or spins. Such hybrid devices allow us to benefit from the advantages of each block and compensate for their disadvantages. Specifically, the SC qubits can rapidly implement quantum logic gates, but are ``noisy'' (prone to decoherence), while collective states of the atomic or spin ensemble are ``quiet''(protected from decoherence) and thus can be employed for storage of quantum information. To improve the overall performance (fidelity) of such devices we discuss dynamical control to optimize quantum state-transfer from a ``noisy'' qubit to the ``quiet'' storage ensemble. We propose to maximize the fidelity of transfer and storage in a spectrally inhomogeneous spin ensemble, by pre-selecting the optimal spectral portion of the ensemble. Significant improvements of the overall fidelity of hybrid devices are expected under realistic conditions. Experimental progress towards the realization of these schemes is discussed.},

  abstract = {The Dirac variation-of-constants method has long provided a basis for perturbative solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. In spite of its widespread utilization, certain aspects of the method have been discussed only superficially and remain somewhat obscure. The present review attempts to clarify some of these points, particularly those related to secular and normalization terms. Secular terms arise from an over-all time-dependent phase in the wave function, while normalization terms preserve the norm of the wave function. A proper treatment of the secular terms is essential in the presence of a physically significant level shift that can produce secular divergences in the time-dependent perturbation functions. The normalization terms are always important, although the formulation of a simple method for including them is of greatest utility in applications requiring higher-order perturbation theory (e.g., nonlinear optical phenomena), where difficulties have arisen in previous treatments. Although the Dirac perturbation technique includes the correct secular and normalization terms when properly executed, it is convenient to reinterpret the perturbation problem so that the secular and normalization terms can be factored from the wave function to all orders. It is shown that an appropriate over-all multiplicative, time-dependent normalization and phase factor can be obtained, and that it is simply the amplitude for finding the system in the unperturbed eigenstate at any time t. The regular part of the wave function remaining after this factorization provides a complete description of the physical properties of the system of interest and determines the over-all normalization and phase, as well. Most important, the regular function and its perturbation expansion satisfy equations which are more convenient for computational applications than are the customary Dirac equations, and, in contrast to the latter, they reduce directly to the familiar time-independent perturbation equations in the static limit. To illustrate the general development, the model problem of a linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator and the static, harmonic, and electromagnetic perturbations of arbitrary quantum-mechanical systems are treated explicitly. In the case of an adiabatically applied static perturbation, the familiar adiabatic theorem is recovered with the over-all phase factor giving the perturbed eigenvalue, while in the case of an harmonic perturbation, the overall phase factor obtained includes the system level shift appropriate for a quasiperiodic state. For an electromagnetic perturbation, compact expressions are obtained for various nonlinear optical susceptibilities in forms suitable for computations. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximations are treated explicity to demonstrate that difficulties can arise when normalization and secular terms are not extracted prior to application of the perturbation formalism. Connection is also made with other methods which can be employed to eliminate secular and normalization terms from the wave function; these include a projection procedure and multiple-time-scales perturbation theory. The elimination of secular divergences from the perturbation functions is shown to be important for the construction of a valid Fourier transform. Secular and normalization terms also arise in connection with variational principles for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. By employing the Frenkel variational principle and an ansatz for the total wave function that explicitly isolates the secular and normalization terms, a computationally convenient variational functional is obtained. This form of the Frenkel principle provides a bound to the system level shift induced by an oscillatory perturbation and is equivalent to the Ritz variational principle in the static limit. Explicit expressions for the variational functional in the Hartree-Fock approximations are derived in forms suitable for computational applications to the interactions of radiation and matter.},

@ARTICLE{rmp_57_783,
  abstract = {In 1978 it was discovered, largely through the work of Fleischmann, Van Duyne, Creighton, and their coworkers that molecules adsorbed on specially prepared silver surfaces produce a Raman spectrum that is at times a millionfold more intense than expected. This effect was dubbed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Since then the effect has been demonstrated with many molecules and with a number of metals, including Cu, Ag, Au, Li, Na, K, In, Pt, and Rh. In addition, related phenomena such as surface-enhanced second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, absorption, and fluorescence have been observed. Although not all fine points of the enhancement mechanism have been clarified, the majority view is that the largest contributor to the intensity amplification results from the electric field enhancement that occurs in the vicinity of small, interacting metal particles that are illuminated with light resonant or near resonant with the localized surface-plasmon frequency of the metal structure. Small in this context is gauged in relation to the wavelength of light. The special preparations required to produce the effect, which include among other techniques electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycling, deposition of metal on very cold substrates, and the generation of metal-island films and colloids, is now understood to be necessary as a means of producing surfaces with appropriate electromagnetic resonances that may couple to electromagnetic fields either by generating rough films (as in the case of the former two examples) or by placing small metal particles in close proximity to one another (as in the case of the latter two). For molecules chemisorbed on SERS-active surface there exists a "chemical enhancement" in addition to the electromagnetic effect. Although difficult to measure accurately, the magnitude of this effect rarely exceeds a factor of 10 and is best thought to arise from the modification of the Raman polarizability tensor of the adsorbate resulting from the formation of a complex between the adsorbate and the metal. Rather than an enhancement mechanism, the chemical effect is more logically to be regarded as a change in the nature and identity of the adsorbate.},

  abstract = {The subject of small metallic particle properties is outlined with emphasis on quantum electronic effects. The theoretical background for interpretation of experiments is discussed beginning with the work of Kubo. More recent amendments to this have been included, taking into account the techniques of random matrix theory and effects of the spin-orbit interaction. A general review of experimental work is presented in order to permit a comprehensive evaluation of current understanding of the quantum size effect on the electronic spectrum. This survey includes magnetic susceptibility, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, heat capacity, optical, and infrared absorption measurements. These are discussed in many instances from the point of view of there being competing size effects arising from a reduced volume contrasted with those from the surface. A number of stimulating and provocative results have led to the development of new areas of research involving metallic clusters such as cluster beam techniques, far-infrared absorption by particle clusters, adsorbate NMR, and particle-matrix composites. Although there is little question that the experiments themselves indicate the existence of quantum effects, there are as yet, insufficient results to test the theoretical predictions for electron-level distribution functions based on fundamental symmetries of the electron Hamiltonian. A new suggestion for measurement of the electron-level correlation function is made using the magnetic field dependence of the NMR Knight shift. Particle preparation methods are also reviewed with commentary on the problems and advantages of these techniques for investigation of quantum electronic effects.},

On the experimental side, the rapid development of new techniques for producing the clusters and for probing and detecting them has resulted in a phenomenal increase in our knowledge of these systems. For clusters of the simplest metals, the alkali and noble metals, the electronic structure is dominated by the number of valence electrons, and the ionic cores are of secondary importance. These electrons are delocalized, and the electronic system exhibits a shell structure that is closely related to the well-known nuclear shell structure. In this article the results from a broad range of experiments are reviewed and compared with theory. Included are the behavior of the mass-abundance spectra, polarizabilities, ionization potentials, photoelectron spectra, optical spectra, and fragmentation phenomena.},

  abstract = {Studies of the Raman and i.r. spectra of several molecules adsorbed to metal surfaces indicate that special selection rules govern these spectra. In the case of i.r. reflection adsorption spectroscopy (IRS) as in the related techniques of electron energy loss spectroscopy (ELS) and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS), only modes which develop dipole moment perpendicular to the metal surface can be excited. We have shown that an image field model which has been proposed to account for these observations is equivalent to the presence of a new symmetry operation which consists of simultaneous reflection in the plane of the metal surface plus charge conjugation. As a result, instead of the point group of the molecule, the symmetry group which should be used to analyze the motions of a molecule adsorbed to a metal surface consists of the direct product group of the molecular point group and another which is isomorphous with C2. Furthermore, the activity representations of the system, molecule + image, for both i.r. and Raman spectra, are those which are compatible with the totally symmetric representation of C2. Both i.r. and Raman spectra of oriented metal adsorbates can therefore be used to probe molecular orientation. Depolarization ratios for specific orientations and scattering geometries have been derived and used to analyze the results of several experimental examples. The adsorbed molecule whose Raman spectrum has been most thoroughly studied is pyridine on silver. Using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, we have been able to show that the silver surfaces are atomically quite clean. The case of pyridine adsorbed on Ag is also of interest because of the relative intensity of some of its Raman lines. By comparison with the same lines in liquid pyridine, the intensity is apparently enhanced by a factor of 104. Several theories of this enhancement are analyzed, including the possibility that the enhancement is a demonstration of the resonance Raman effect in which the surface plasmons mix with molecular electronic states so as to form a continuum of intermediate states for the scattering. Each theory implies a particular dependence of the Raman intensity on the frequency of the exciting radiation. Resonance interaction with the surface plasmons gives the closest agreement with experimental results.},

The polarizability derivatives are of relevance to the interpretation of surface enhanced Raman (SER) spectra. Basis set convergence of these spectroscopic properties is studied, along with the effect of including electron correlation at the second-order polarization propagator (SOPPA) level, and the variation of the results with excitation frequency. The largest basis set SOPPA results that we have generated appear to be converged to within 20% or better for most of the properties we have studied, however in a few cases the convergence is much poorer. The most difficult property to converge involves the off-diagonal component of the derivatives of the quadrupole-dipole polarizability tensor. Our results show that the ratio of the largest components of A to the largest components of [alpha] are on the order of one atomic unit in size, and a similar statement can be made concerning the corresponding ratios of the normal coordinate derivatives. This means that the ratio of field derivatives to field strengths will also have to be on the order of one atomic unit in order for A and C to contribute comparably to [alpha] in determining SERS intensities.},

In particular, we can theoretically reproduce the significant changes in the relative Raman intensities of the [nu]12 mode in pyridine-metal cluster complexes. We focus on two mechanisms for these Raman intensities changes: (1) the chemical interaction between the pyridine and the metal clusters; and (2) the charge transfer mechanism. For the pyridine-silver cluster complexes, we find that due to the weak bonding, the chemical interaction does not influence the relative intensities of the Raman peaks of the [nu]1 and [nu]12 modes. However, in the case where the copper or the gold clusters are attached to pyridine, the intensity of the band of the [nu]12 mode is weakened significantly. We also find that the charge transfer mechanism increases the asymmetry of the bands of the [nu]1 and [nu]12 modes on all three metals.},

  abstract = {The molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of 4,4'-bipyridine (BPE) in the ground state were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) methods (B3LYP) with 6-31++G(d,p) basis set. The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles are obtained by DFT employing the hybrid of Beckes non-local three parameter exchange and correlation functional and Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Fourier transform Raman (FT Raman) and near-infrared surface-enhanced Raman scattering (NIR-SERS) spectra of BPE on the silver foil substrate have been recorded. All FT IR, FT-Raman and NIR-SERS band were assigned on the basis of the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) method. The vibrational frequencies obtained by DFT(3LYP) are in good agreement with observed results. The NIR-SERS of BPE excited by 1064 nm laser line is little difference with that excited by visible laser line. This phenomenon is result to the increase of the contribution of CHEM enhancement effect. Surface selection rules derived from the electromagnetic enhancement model were employed to infer the orientations of BPE on the silver foil substrate surface. Some vibrational frequency which are sensitive to the planar or non-planar structure of BPE, and to the dihedral angle were concluded.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) methods have been used to investigate the adsorption site effect of Raman scattering for neutral and charged pyridine-Ag4 complexes. The calculated results show that the SERS spectra are strongly dependent on adsorption site and the configuration of new complexes. The normal Raman spectra of neutral and charged pyridine-Ag4 complexes are similar with that of isolated pyridine but with an enhancement factor below 10 times. This enhancement is ascribed to ground state chemical enhancement. The pre-surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra were calculated at 1256?nm, 769?nm and 744.3?nm, which are nearly resonant with the charge transfer excited states S2 for neutral and charged pyridine-Ag4 complexes, respectively. We obtain the enhancement factor about 104 to 105 in pre-SERS spectra which is mainly caused by charge transfer resonance Raman enhancement. The three-dimensional cube representation is also applied to describe the photoinduced CT, which are considered as direct evidence of chemical enhancement, between pyridine and two isomers of Ag4 clusters.},

The pre-SERS intensities of the above three structures enhanced evidently compared to corresponding NRS intensities, and the enhancement mechanism was confirmed to charge transfer (CT) resonance Raman enhancement. The largest enhanced orders of NRS and pre-SERS intensities among the three structures were up to 103 and 105, respectively. Compared the intensity of pre-SERS with corresponding intensity of NRS spectra, the enhancement effect of Pyrazine-Ag2 complex was larger than the others.

The excitation of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photo-bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional, spatially resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of caged effector molecules.},

Synthesized bis(styryl)benzene derivatives with donor-pi -donor, donor-acceptor-donor, and acceptor-donor-acceptor structural motifs exhibit exceptionally large values of delta , up to about 400 times that of trans-stilbene. Quantum chemical calculations performed on these molecules indicate that substantial symmetric charge redistribution occurs upon excitation and provide delta values in good agreement with experimental values.

The localization process is proposed to be coupled to nondiffusive solvation dynamics. In contrast, measurements sampling population dynamics show spectral evolution associated with wave packet motion on the excited state surface that is independent of solvent. The results therefore reveal two important contributions to the evolution of charge transfer states in condensed phase, one that is strongly coupled to the surrounding environment and another that follows a potential internal to the molecule.},

By proper design of the working wavelength and the thickness of silver that allows access to a broad spectrum of subwavelength features, we also showed that arbitrary nanostructures can be imaged with good fidelity. The optical superlens promises exciting avenues to nanoscale optical imaging and ultrasmall optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {The calculation time for the energy of atoms and molecules scales exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to problems of chemical interest using modest numbers of quantum bits. Calculations of the water and lithium hydride molecular ground-state energies have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive phase-estimation algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the number of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the molecular wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule. The number of quantum bits required scales linearly with the number of basis functions, and the number of gates required grows polynomially with the number of quantum bits.},

However, the performance of electronic circuits is now becoming rather limited when digital information needs to be sent from one point to another. Photonics offers an effective solution to this problem by implementing optical communication systems based on optical fibers and photonic circuits. Unfortunately, the micrometer-scale bulky components of photonics have limited the integration of these components into electronic chips, which are now measured in nanometers. Surface plasmon-based circuits, which merge electronics and photonics at the nanoscale, may offer a solution to this size-compatibility problem.

Coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond was used to gain insight into its local environment. We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.},

Using optical and microwave radiation to control an electron spin associated with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond, we demonstrated robust initialization of electron and nuclear spin quantum bits (qubits) and transfer of arbitrary quantum states between them at room temperature. Moreover, nuclear spin qubits could be well isolated from the electron spin, even during optical polarization and measurement of the electronic state. Finally, coherent interactions between individual nuclear spin qubits were observed and their excellent coherence properties were demonstrated.

This reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium complex based on a dearomatized PNN-type ligand {[}where PNN is 2-(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-6-(diethylaminomethyl) pyridine], and no base or acid promoters are required.

At large sizes (>100 nanometers), they behave as conventional single-electron transistors, exhibiting periodic Coulomb blockade peaks. For quantum dots smaller than 100 nanometers, the peaks become strongly nonperiodic, indicating a major contribution of quantum confinement. Random peak spacing and its statistics are well described by the theory of chaotic neutrino billiards. Short constrictions of only a few nanometers in width remain conductive and reveal a confinement gap of up to 0.5 electron volt, demonstrating the possibility of molecular-scale electronics based on graphene.},

We describe a solution-phase reaction scheme that leads to the stoichiometric liberation of dihydrogen and dioxygen in consecutive thermal- and light-driven steps mediated by mononuclear, well-defined ruthenium complexes. The initial reaction of water at 25{degrees}C with a dearomatized ruthenium (II) [Ru(II)] pincer complex yields a monomeric aromatic Ru(II) hydrido-hydroxo complex that, on further reaction with water at 100{degrees}C, releases H2 and forms a cis dihydroxo complex. Irradiation of this complex in the 320-to-420-nanometer range liberates oxygen and regenerates the starting hydrido-hydroxo Ru(II) complex, probably by elimination of hydrogen peroxide, which rapidly disproportionates. Isotopic labeling experiments with H217O and H218O show unequivocally that the process of oxygen-oxygen bond formation is intramolecular, establishing a previously elusive fundamental step toward dioxygen-generating homogeneous catalysis.},

With sequences of up to 100 gates and 6 qubits, the full time dynamics of a range of spin systems are digitally simulated. Interactions beyond those naturally present in our simulator are accurately reproduced, and quantitative bounds are provided for the overall simulation quality. Our results demonstrate the key principles of digital quantum simulation and provide evidence that the level of control required for a full-scale device is within reach.},

@ARTICLE{siam_15_313,
  abstract = {Recently, the authors proposed a new Krylov subspace iteration, the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) algorithm, for solving non-Hermitian linear systems. In the original implementation of the QMR method, the Lanczos process with look-ahead is used to generate basis vectors for the underlying Krylov subspaces. In the Lanczos algorithm, these basis vectors are computed by means of three-term recurrences. It has been observed that, in finite-precision arithmetic, vector iterations based on three-term recursions are usually less robust than mathematically equivalent coupled two-term vector recurrences. This paper presents a look-ahead algorithm that constructs the Lanczos basis vectors by means of coupled two-term recursions. Some implementation details are given, and the look-ahead strategy is described. A new implementation of the QMR method, based on this coupled two-term algorithm, is proposed. A simplified version of the QMR algorithm without look-ahead is also presented, and the special case of QMR for complex symmetric linear systems is considered. Results of numerical experiments comparing the original and the new implementations of the QMR method are reported.},

  abstract = {The discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) is a method for calculating the scattering of light by an irregular particle. The DDA has been used, for example, in calculations of optical properties of cosmic dust. In this method the particle is approximated by interacting electromagnetic dipoles. Computationally the DDA method includes the solution of large dense systems of linear equations where the coefficient matrix is complex symmetric. In this work, the linear systems of equations are solved by various iterative methods. QMR was found to be the best iterative method in this application. It converged in only a few more iterations than the full generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. When the discretization of the particle was refined, the number of iterations remained constant even without preconditioning. The matrix–vector product in the iterative methods can be computed with the fast Fourier transform or the fast multipole algorithm. These algorithms make it feasible to solve dense linear systems of hundreds of thousands of unknowns.},

  abstract = {The boundary element method has become a popular tool for the solution of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism. From a linear algebra point of view, this leads to the solution of large dense complex linear systems, where the unknowns are associated with the edges of the mesh defined on the surface of the illuminated object. In this paper, we address the iterative solution of these linear systems via preconditioned Krylov solvers. Our primary focus is on the design of an efficient parallelizable preconditioner. In that respect, we consider an approximate inverse method based on the Frobenius-norm minimization. The preconditioner is constructed from a sparse approximation of the dense coefficient matrix, and the patterns both for the preconditioner and for the coefficient matrix are computed a priori using geometric information from the mesh. We describe how such a preconditioner can be naturally implemented in a parallel code that implements the multipole technique for the matrix-vector product calculation. We investigate the numerical scalability of our preconditioner on realistic industrial test problems and show that it exhibits some limitations on very large problems of size close to one million unknowns. To improve its robustness on those large problems we propose an embedded iterative scheme that combines nested GMRES solvers with different fast multipole computations. We show through extensive numerical experiments that this new scheme is extremely robust at affordable memory and CPU costs for the solution of very large and challenging problems.},

Such linear systems arise in important applications, such as the numerical solution of the complex Helmholtz equation. Furthermore, most complex non-Hermitian linear systems which occur in practice are actually complex symmetric. Conjugate gradient-type iterations which are based on a variant of the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm for complex symmetric matrices are investigated. In particular, a new approach with iterates defined by a quasi-minimal residual property is proposed. The resulting algorithm presents several advantages over the standard biconjugate gradient method.

First, silver-embedded magnetic NPs are prepared, composed of an 18-nm magnetic core and a 16-nm-thick silica shell with silver NPs formed on the surface. After simple aromatic compounds are adsorbed on the silver-embedded magnetic NPs, they are coated with silica to provide them with chemical and physical stability. The resulting silica-encapsulated magnetic NPs (M-SERS dots) produce strong SERS signals and have magnetic properties. In a model application as a tagging material, the M-SERS dots are successfully utilized for targeting breast-cancer cells (SKBR3) and floating leukemia cells (SP2/O). The targeted cancer cells can be easily separated from the untargeted cells using an external magnetic field. The separated targeted cancer cells exhibit a Raman signal originating from the M-SERS dots. This system proves to be an efficient tool for separating targeted cells. Additionally, the magnetic-field-induced hot spots, which can provide a 1000-times-stronger SERS intensity due to aggregation of the NPs, are studied.},

  abstract = {The comparison of Raman spectra of a pure water solution with those of an aqueous AG colloid reveals only very weak differences. This indicates, not unexpectedly, a low electromagnetic (EM) enhancement factor (F [approximate] 100) for the Raman scattering of water. Just in opposite to these weak effects, the addition of Ag sol to a rhodamine 6G solution causes the replacement of the former solution fluorescence by a similar intense surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS). At higher dye concentrations (up to ) it is replaced by both, by SERRS and surface fluorescence. The SERRS cross section is generally higher than 10 -20 cm2 sr-1 molecule-1 photon-1. This indicates that a model based on a combination of weak EM resonances with molecular resonance Raman effects cannot explain a total enhancement by more than 10 orders of magnitude. An energy-transfer model seems to be more suitable.},

The experimental work is considered in detail but we focus on the region close to the substrate, less than 500 nm away because the longer distance regime has been well reviewed.

  abstract = {In addition to the electromagnetic influences which increase the local field at the surface of suitably rough free-electron-like metals, molecule and site specific electronic resonances are also frequently operative. This leads to enhanced scattering beyond that caused by the electromagnetic mechanism alone. The electronic resonances involve charge-transfer excitation between members of an active complex MwAgxCly(H2O)z which involves the probe molecule M and, in the electrochemical environment, the constituents of the solution. These complexes allow the resonance to be communicated to Raman transitions in all members of the complex. The stability of the complexes are sensitive to changes in the environment, such as the applied voltage and to the presence of foreign metal ions, through induced changes in y, the number of halide or pseudo-halide ions in the complex. Through analysis of the vibrational signature of the probe molecule under various environmental influences we are able to observe subtle changes in the character of the bonding between that molecule and the rest of the complex. These changes can also be interpreted as indirect results of changes in the value of y.},

  abstract = {The optical response of molecucules adsorbed at or near interfaces are known to be strongly modified relative to those of the free molecules. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering is the most prominent example, however practically all molecular optical properties are affected. In this paper we review the electromagnetic theory of these phenomena with particular emphasis on resonance processes. We discuss lifetimes of excited molecular states, absorption, resonance Raman and fluorescence cross-sections, light scattering and emission yields, energy transfer between adsorbed molecules and photochemical processes. The electromagnetic theory of these phenomena incorporates the surface effect on the local electromagnetic field intensity with the surface-induced radiative and nonradiative decay rates to give working expressions for cross-sections, rates and yields of surface optical processes in terms of the incident beam direction, polarization and frequency, geometry and optical properties of the substrate and its environment and of the optical properties, location and orientation (relative to the substrate) of the adsorbed molecule. Available experimental results are in good qualitative or semiquantitative agreement with the theory. In addition we consider the role of cavity sites in surface-enhanced optical processes. We discuss two models for cavity sites, the conical wedge and enclosures between small particles. The latter are shown to be associated with particularly large enhancements both of the local field intensity and of the surface-induced radiative and nonradiative decay rates. Finally we dwell on the optical properties of small molecular particles which, near the molecular resonance, may give rise to strong local field enhancement provided that the molecules respond coherently to the incident radiation field. We show that the overall response depends on the rate of dephasing processes, which act to drive molecules out of phase with each other. The actual enhancements depend on this rate and on the particle size and shape.},

  abstract = {The Raman spectrum due to vibrational excitations in molecules adsorbed on a solid surface differs from the corresponding molecules in the liquid or the free state in many important aspects. Because of the substrate-molecule interaction, the ground-state electronic charge density distribution, the nature of the electronic excitation spectrum, the modulation behaviour of the modified electronic polarizability due to ionic vibrations, and the ionic fluctuation spectrum including the vibrational mode frequencies of the molecule are no longer the same in the presence of the polarizable substrate as in the case of a free molecule. Besides these intrinsic changes in the system itself, the external optical field at the incident frequency, acting at the site of the adsorbed molecule, is now different than the incident field, and the Stokes scattered field in the radiation zone arising from the adsorbate is modified by the substrate. The last two modifications are purely "electromagnetic" in the sense that they may be important even when the metal-molecule interaction can be neglected either because the bonding is very weak or because their separation distance d is large compared to atomic distances. In suitable situations, the "electromagnetic" modifications contain enhancements of the incident and scattered fields due to resonant excitation of surface-plasmon-polaritons (SPP) in, e.g., metallic substrates. The intrinsic differences arising from interactions at short distances, the so-called "chemical effect", lead to the changes in the intrinsic electronic and Raman polarizabilities so that the Raman cross sections are enhanced in special situations, including the possibility of new resonance Raman conditions involving the modified single-particle excited charge-transfer states of the coupled system. In this presentation, a simplified model of electronic interactions of a molecule on a solid surface is used to formulate a general theory of surface Raman scattering. It is shown how this theory can take care of both the electromagnetic as well as the chemical modifications in different systems, whether or not there is any net large enhancement in the Raman cross sections. To account for the bonding and tunneling of electrons at the surface, a consistent quantum formulation for the surface Raman scattering becomes absolutely essential to analyse experimental results and distinguish between different mechanisms for the enhancement or otherwise of the Raman cross sections.},

This chemical enhancement factor is very close to that for pyridine adsorbed on silver ("charge transfer" from the metal to the adsorbed molecule).

  abstract = {Nickel modified by the chiral molecule (R,R)-tartaric acid yields one of the most successful heterogeneous enantioselective catalysts. We have recently shown that the geometric consequence of adsorbing the doubly deprotonated (R,R)-bitartrate on Ni(1 1 0) is to force the bonding Ni atoms to describe a chiral footprint at the surface. Here, we analyse the electronic consequences of chiral molecule-achiral metal adsorption via a detailed analysis of the charge distribution and electronic states of (R,R)-bitartrate adsorbed to four Ni atoms. Gas phase (R,R)-bitartrate was found to carry a chiral asymmetry in the charge distribution at the oxygen atoms of the bonding carboxylate groups, showing there is direct electronic communication of chirality from the molecule's chiral centres to its bonding groups. Upon adsorption to the nickel atoms, this electronic asymmetry is removed and, instead, the chiral signature is transferred into the hybridised molecule-metal electron states which are responsible for the charge transfer between the bonding oxygens and the nickel atoms. Furthermore, chiral inequivalence is observed in the four Ni-O bonds, and, consequently, also in the single-electron wavefunctions centred at the four nickel atoms. As a result, the adsorption site, made up of the four nickel atoms, possesses an electronic structure composed of chiral single-electron wavefunctions. This clearly demonstrates that the induction of chirality from an organic molecule to a metal occurs at the level of single-electron states. We would expect this chirality to be conveyed, via Ni-Ni metallic bonds, onto an extended metal surface. Finally, we also predict chiral responses of the surface electron structure upon excitation e.g. by photons.},

  abstract = {Using a genetic algorithm followed by local optimization with density functional theory, the lowest-energy structures of Ag_{20} clusters in a size range of n=3-22 were studied. The Ag_{n} (n=9-16) clusters prefer compact structures of flat shape, while the Ag_{n} (n = 19, 21, 22) clusters adopt amorphous packing based on a 13-atom icosahedral core. For Ag_{16}, two competitive candidates for the lowest-energy structures, namely a hollow-cage structure and close-packed structures of flat shape, were found. Two competing candidates were found for Ag_{17} and Ag_{18}: hollow-cage structures versus icosahedron-based compact structures. The lowest-energy structure of Ag_{20} is a highly symmetric tetrahedron with Td symmetry. These results are significantly different from those predicted in earlier works using empirical methods. The ionization potentials and electron affinities for the lowest-energy structures of Ag_{n} (n=3-22) clusters were computed and compared with experimental values.},

  abstract = {Surface science techniques have now reached a stage of maturity that has enabled their successful deployment in the study of complex adsorption systems. A particular example of this success has been the understanding that has been gained regarding the behaviour of multi-functional organic molecules at metal surfaces. These organic-metal systems show enormous diversity, starting from their local description which can vary in terms of chemical structure, orientation and bonding. Additionally, in many cases, these complex organic molecules self-organise into beautiful, ordered superstructures held together by networks of intermolecular bonds. Both these aspects enable a single organic molecule-metal system to exhibit a wide-ranging and flexible approach to its environment, leading to a variety of adsorption phases, according to the prevailing temperature and coverage conditions. In this review we have attempted to capture this complexity by constructing adsorption phase diagrams from the available literature for complex carboxylic acids, amino acids, anhydrides and ring systems, all deposited under controlled conditions onto defined metal surfaces. These provide an accessible, pictorial basis of the adsorption phases which are then discussed further in the text of the review. Finally, interest has recently focused on the property of chirality that can be bestowed at an achiral metal surface by the adsorption of these complex organic molecules. The creation of such architectures offers the opportunity for ultimate stereocontrol of reactions and responses at surfaces. We have, therefore, specifically examined the various ways in which chirality can be expressed at a surface and provide a framework for classifying chiral hierarchies that are manifested at surfaces, with particular attention being paid to the progression of chirality from a local to a global level.},

A basis for color generation is discussed in which the tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene), serves as the \pi{}-electron deficient ring which circumrotates between three -electron rich recognition sites within a macrocyclic polyether, generating the three different colors (RGB) based on the different charge transfer interactions between the tetracationic cyclophane and recognition sites based on 1,5-dioxynaphthalene (R), tetrathiafulvalene (G) and benzidine (B). Issues relating to the realization of an RGB [2]catenane are raised and discussed: they include (i) color tuning, (ii) thermodynamic considerations, (iii) electrochemistry on model compounds, (iv) molecular design, (v) the electrochemical behavior of three-station [2]catenanes and (vi) electrochromism in polymer gel matrices. Finally, the challenges that need to be met in the future if the ideal RGB catenane is to be prepared, are outlined.},

It is desirable to develop an algorithm for this step that scales linearly with system size. We discuss attempts to achieve linear scaling for the calculation of the matrix elements of the exchange-correlation and Coulomb potentials within a particular implementation (the Amsterdam density functional, ADF, code) of the KS method. In the ADF scheme the matrix elements are completely determined by 3D numerical integration, the value of the potentials in each grid point being determined with the help of an auxiliary function representation of the electronic density. Nearly linear scaling for building the total Fock matrix is demonstrated for systems of intermediate size (in the order of 1000 atoms). For larger systems further development is desirable for the treatment of the Coulomb potential.},

The results of standard calculations agree well with previous results. It is shown that starting from a triplet reference, spin-flip TDDFT can successfully optimize the geometry of the four lowest singlet states of CH2 and three other isovalent species. Spin-flip TDDFT is used to calculate the potential energy curve of the breaking of the C\^aC bond of ethane.

The rates of the alkylation reactions of bis(pyridine) versions of the photochromic compounds are also evaluated to provide a better understanding of the through-bond and the through-space effects of the groups located at the ends of the linearly conjugated pi-electron backbone.

Receptor 1 binds quasi-planar nitroaromatic guests in its 1,3-alternate conformation, while release of these guests takes place upon addition of chloride anions.

  abstract = {SERS spectra of 2-methylpyrazine have been recorded on silver electrode in a range of potential from 0.00 to -0.75 V vs. a saturated Ag/AgCl/KCl reference electrode. The so obtained spectra have been compared with the Raman of the aqueous solution and the observed differences between the relative intensities of Raman and SERS spectra have been interpreted on the basis of a charge transfer mechanism. The most enhanced bands correspond to modes that relate the equilibrium geometries of the neutral molecules and its anion radical, while the behaviour of other less enhanced bands is due to vibronic coupling between the ground state of the anion radical and other of its possible excited states. In order to check this enhancement mechanism, we have used the theoretical results provided by ab initio calculations on the neutral molecule and its anion radical.},

  abstract = {The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of 4-methylpyridine (4-MP) have been recorded at different electrode potential versus saturated Ag/AgCl/KCl reference electrode. By comparing the relative intensity of the SERS with the Raman spectrum of the aqueous solution it is possible to determine that 12, 6a, {\^I}'(CH) and especially 8a modes are strongly enhanced. In this work, it is demonstrated that these vibrations are closely related to Franck-Condon factors of a resonant photoinduced charge transfer (CT) mechanism similar to a resonance Raman (RR) process. The theoretically calculated {\^I}-Q displacements represent the differences between geometries of the potential energy minima of the states involved in the resonant process, allowing to calculate the relative intensities in RR from the Peticolas' equation. These calculated intensities are in a perfect agreement with the experimental behavior.},

  abstract = {The surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of 2,3-dimethylpyrazine adsorbed on silver have been recorded at different electrode potentials. The main feature of the SERS spectra is the selective enhancement of the vibration 8a, while the remaining vibrations do not undergo any noticeable enhancement. This behavior has been explained according to a photoinduced charge transfer mechanism between the metal and the adsorbate, involving the ground electronic states of the neutral molecule (S0 state) and the radical anion (D0 state), given that the incoming photon induces the transfer of an electron from the Fermi level of the metal to vacant orbitals of the adsorbate.},

Tartrate ion behaves in turn in a similar way in acid medium, but in basic medium it lies almost perpendicular to the metal surface.

  abstract = {The absorbance of bands in the infrared spectrum of species located within 5 nm of the surface of metal nanoparticles deposited on dielectric substrates is known to be increased by between one and three orders of magnitude through the phenomenon known as surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA). The mechanism of SEIRA is still not fully understood. For example, under certain circumstances, the band shapes in SEIRA spectra become asymmetric. One cause of this asymmetry that has been postulated is a chemical interaction between the molecule and the metal surface. In a previous paper, we showed that adsorbate bands first become asymmetric when the metal nanoparticles start to percolate (coalesce) and that a chemical interaction is not needed to induce this effect. In this paper, we report the results of experiments in which a horizontal internal reflection element is coated with silver nanoparticles to a nominal thickness of between 5 and 10 nm. At the onset of percolation, the absorption bands of molecules in contact with the surface of the silver nanoparticles become asymmetric, whether these molecules are chemisorbed thiols or bulk solvents such as n-heptane that have little interaction with the silver surface. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of p-fluorothiophenol (PFTP) acts as a molecular spacer between the metal and any solvent with which it is in contact. The asymmetry of the PFTP bands is the same in the absence and presence of the solvent, whereas the asymmetry of the solvent bands was reduced when the silver surface is coated with a SAM of PFTP. From these results, we deduce that the band asymmetry is caused by an electrical interaction that occurs very close to the surface of the metal nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {The shape of bands in surface-enhanced infrared spectra of molecules near the surface of metal nanoparticles is shown to depend on whether or not the nanoparticles have exceeded the percolation threshold. If the nanoparticles are in the form of independent metal islands, the absorption bands of molecules within 5 nm of the surface are symmetrical. Immediately after the percolation threshold has been exceeded, the bands start to assume a dispersive shape. The greatest enhancement is found immediately after the percolation threshold has been exceeded. This effect was shown both for the metals that are most commonly applied to surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) studies, namely silver and gold, but also to zinc for which surface enhancement has not previously been reported and appears to be applicable to all metals.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum of very good quality of "silver nano-pC60/silver film" system was reported for the first time by using the pyridine as a intermediate to connect and nest the C60 molecules to the gap of silver nano-particles and silver film. Experiment results show that the ternary system of "silver nano-particies/C60/silver film" is very effective and active. Not only was the number of vibrational modes greatly increased, especially some modes that were forbidden in Raman spectrum, but also were the significant Raman bands splitted as well as frequencies up and down shifted, respectively, arising from symmetry lowering and selection rule relaxing of C60 induced by the silver surface. Furthermore, the splitting of the Raman modes is consistent with the calculation based on group theory. The adsorption of C60 molecules is oriented on pentagons of C60 on the silver surface. It is difficult to separate the contributions of the electromagnetic and chemical mechanisms to the great enhancement of the Raman signal. On the one hand, the silver nanoparticles modified on the silver film play an important role in magnifying the surface local electric field near the silver surface through resonant surface plasmon excitation. On the other hand, charge transfer factor may not be neglected.},
